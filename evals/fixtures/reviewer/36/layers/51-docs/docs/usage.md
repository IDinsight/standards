# Using the records service

The records service backs the internal records admin tool. Each customer
organization is a tenant. Every request carries the signed-in user, and every
user belongs to one tenant.

## Tenants

- A user sees only the records of their own tenant.
- The tenant always comes from the signed-in user; no request parameter
  selects or changes it.

## Roles

- `admin`, `editor`, and `viewer` can all list records.
- A request without a signed-in user gets `401`; a role that is not allowed
  for a route gets `403`. Role checks run on the server in every handler.

## Listing records

`GET /records` returns JSON with the records of the signed-in user's tenant:

```json
{ "count": 1, "records": [ { "id": 4, "tenantId": "harbor", "title": "Insurance renewal 2026", "owner": "marco", "status": "active", "createdAt": "2026-04-18T16:20:00Z" } ] }
```

Records are ordered by `id`. Each record has `id`, `tenantId`, `title`,
`owner`, `status` (`active` or `archived`), and `createdAt` (ISO 8601, UTC).

## Filtering

Query parameters narrow the list; all given filters must match:

- `status`: `active` or `archived`. Any other value returns `400` with
  `{"error": "unknown status: <value>"}`.
- `owner`: exact owner username, for example `marco`.
- `q`: case-insensitive text that must appear in the title.

Blank values and other parameters are ignored.

Example: `GET /records?status=active&owner=marco` lists marco's active records.

## Errors

Errors are JSON objects of the form `{"error": "..."}`:

| Status | Meaning                                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 400    | Invalid query parameter                  |
| 401    | No signed-in user                        |
| 403    | Role not allowed for this route          |
| 404    | Unknown path                             |
| 405    | Known path, unsupported method           |
| 500    | Unexpected server error                  |
