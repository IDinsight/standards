# S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. Protocol

<!-- standards:framework-owned -->

This file is the canonical contract for shared workflow vocabulary, state,
transitions, recovery, and the installed runtime in S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S.

`README.md` explains the framework at a high level. Individual skills define
role-specific behavior. This protocol defines the rules those skills must share.

Read all of this file before workflow work. It is longer than a single read in
some tools. If a read shows only part of it, such as its beginning, or its
beginning and end with lines left out between them, read the missing lines in
consecutive parts before acting.

## How to read this document

The sections run from foundations (roles, modes, states, the persisted state
record, and the runtime tools) through handoffs, gates, failure and recovery,
expedited cycles, user decisions, record formats, and the installed runtime. The
order is for orientation only: a role applies every applicable rule wherever it
appears. **Canonical Terms**, the last section, defines terms this protocol uses
in a specific sense; consult it whenever a term is load-bearing.

## Roles

```text
Role
- SCOPER
- TESTER
- ARCHITECT
- NAVIGATOR
- DEVELOPER
- AUDITOR
- REVIEWER
- DOCUMENTER
- SYNCHRONIZER
```

A role owns decisions or artifacts; it is not necessarily a workflow state.
Workflow role skills are invoked explicitly by the user. `WorkflowState`
determines whether an invoked role may perform role-owned workflow work; it does
not dispatch a skill automatically. Where supported, client installation must
prevent implicit model invocation of workflow role skills.

`NAVIGATOR` is explicitly invoked, strictly non-mutating, and outside the
workflow state machine. Its **Navigator Boundary** below applies instead of
workflow entry, persistence, completion, and handoff requirements.

State ownership governs role-owned work, not protocol coordination.
**User Decisions and Intervention** defines the control-plane transitions that
an explicit user instruction authorizes regardless of which role owns the
current state. An active workflow role may also `PROMOTE` without separate user
authorization when an expedited cycle can no longer safely remain expedited.

## Project Modes

```text
ProjectMode
- GREENFIELD
- BROWNFIELD
```

- `GREENFIELD`: no meaningful pre-existing project implementation must be
  treated as established baseline.
- `BROWNFIELD`: meaningful implementation already exists and workflow work must
  understand, preserve, extend, repair, or otherwise depend on it.

Choose the initial mode from project state at installation. `GREENFIELD` is
temporary: during the initial greenfield cycle, Developer must permanently
change `.standards/MODE.md` to `BROWNFIELD` as soon as Developer observes and
verifies that the active cycle has successfully created or materially modified a
project implementation artifact. The trigger is implementation existence, not
authorship: it applies equally to code written by Developer and code applied by
the user during Developer collaboration. Workflow metadata and role-owned
planning, context, test, review, or documentation artifacts do not count as
project implementation. The mode never reverts, including during recovery;
only **Project Reset** chooses it again, from the project's contents at that
time.

For a `STANDARD` cycle:

- `GREENFIELD` starts in `SCOPING`.
- `BROWNFIELD` starts in `AUDITING`.

Before the first greenfield audit, missing Auditor-produced project context is
intentional. Treat it as a `PROJECT_CONTEXT` failure only when the active role
actually requires context that cannot be established from completed upstream
artifacts and known project constraints.

Cancellation while still `GREENFIELD` follows **Greenfield Bootstrap
Cancellation**, which resets the workflow. Cancellation after the permanent
transition to `BROWNFIELD` enters terminal `CANCELLED`.

## Cycle Modes

```text
CycleMode
- UNSET
- STANDARD
- EXPEDITED
```

`ProjectMode` describes the persistent implementation baseline. `CycleMode`
records the assurance topology of the active cycle only. `PendingCycleMode`
records an explicit user preference for the next cycle before that cycle exists.
`PendingCycleRequest` and `PendingCycleBlockedOn` durably hold a next-cycle
request only when a pre-cycle decision prevents that request from becoming an
active cycle. All are persisted in `.standards/STATE.md`.

- `CycleMode: UNSET`: no cycle is active yet. It is a coordination value, not an
  execution topology.
- `CycleMode: STANDARD`: the active cycle uses the full topology for the current
  `ProjectMode`.
- `CycleMode: EXPEDITED`: the active cycle uses the bounded brownfield path that
  intentionally omits Scoping, Architecture, Auditing, Testing, Documentation,
  Final Review, and Synchronization unless promoted.
- `PendingCycleMode: UNSET`: no explicit next-cycle preference is persisted.
- `PendingCycleMode: STANDARD | EXPEDITED`: explicit user preference for the
  next cycle. It is not an active topology and must be validated when consumed.
- `PendingCycleRequest: UNSET | <request>`: normally `UNSET`; stores the actual
  next-cycle request only while a pre-cycle decision blocks cycle creation.
- `PendingCycleBlockedOn: NONE | <question>`: unresolved pre-cycle user decision
  for `PendingCycleRequest`, otherwise `NONE`. `PendingCycleRequest` and
  `PendingCycleBlockedOn` are paired: the request is `UNSET` exactly when the
  blocker is `NONE`.

Cycle-mode rules:

1. Installation initializes `CycleMode: UNSET`, `PendingCycleMode: UNSET`,
   `PendingCycleRequest: UNSET`, and `PendingCycleBlockedOn: NONE`. Terminal
   `SIGNED_OFF` and retained `CANCELLED` states reset `CycleMode` to `UNSET`
   after the completed or cancelled cycle's mode-specific transition rules have
   been applied; all pending-cycle fields must be clear at that point.
2. No role-owned workflow work may proceed with `CycleMode: UNSET`. A cycle's
   mode is chosen, validated, and persisted when it starts, under **Start a
   cycle**; the user sets a pending preference under **Choose the next cycle's
   mode**.
3. `GREENFIELD` supports only `STANDARD`. A pending `EXPEDITED` preference is
   invalid in `GREENFIELD` and must not be persisted.
4. `BROWNFIELD` supports both execution modes. Without a pending preference,
   `STANDARD` is the default, except that an explicit Developer invocation for a
   sufficiently bounded brownfield implementation change may select
   `EXPEDITED`.
5. The rules for keeping, promoting, and completing an expedited cycle are in
   **Expedited Cycle Contract** and **Expedited Promotion**.

## Workflow States

```text
WorkflowState
- SCOPING
- ARCHITECTING
- AUDITING
- DEVELOPING
- TESTING
- REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION
- DOCUMENTING
- REVIEWING_FINAL
- SYNCHRONIZING
- AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF
- SIGNED_OFF
- CANCELLED
```

`.standards/STATE.md` records exactly one `WorkflowState`, one `CycleMode`, and
one set of pending-cycle coordination fields: `PendingCycleMode`,
`PendingCycleRequest`, and `PendingCycleBlockedOn`. `SIGNED_OFF` and `CANCELLED`
are terminal and mean there is no active cycle. In a terminal state, `CycleMode`
is `UNSET`; persisted `Active Work` data describe the most recent cycle for
traceability until `NEW_CYCLE` replaces them, while the pending-cycle fields may
independently describe an explicit next-cycle preference or a blocked next-cycle
request.

The owning role for each state is:

| Workflow state | Owning role |
| --- | --- |
| `SCOPING` | `SCOPER` |
| `ARCHITECTING` | `ARCHITECT` |
| `AUDITING` | `AUDITOR` |
| `DEVELOPING` | `DEVELOPER` |
| `TESTING` | `TESTER` |
| `REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION` | `REVIEWER` |
| `DOCUMENTING` | `DOCUMENTER` |
| `REVIEWING_FINAL` | `REVIEWER` |
| `SYNCHRONIZING` | `SYNCHRONIZER` |
| `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF` | User |
| `SIGNED_OFF` | User (terminal) |
| `CANCELLED` | User (terminal) |

## Persisted Workflow State

`.standards/STATE.md` is the authoritative, branch-persisted, version-controlled
record needed to resume workflow work across sessions or agents. Before workflow
work, read `.standards/PROTOCOL.md`, `.standards/MODE.md`, and
`.standards/STATE.md`. Resume
from persisted state, active work, handoff, recovery context, and outstanding
corrective obligations; do not infer a different state from chat history or
artifact presence.

`STATE.md` uses this shape:

```markdown
# S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. Workflow State

`WorkflowState`: `ARCHITECTING`
`CycleMode`: `STANDARD`
`PendingCycleMode`: `UNSET`
`PendingCycleRequest`: `UNSET`
`PendingCycleBlockedOn`: `NONE`

## Active Work

`Id`: `add-user-search-by-name-and-email-20260923T150000Z-a7f3c2e9`
`Request`: `Add user search by name and email.` `Scope`: `docs/scope/add-user-search.md`
`Architecture`: `docs/specs/add-user-search.md`
`Development`: `.standards/docs/development/add-user-search-by-name-and-email-20260923T150000Z-a7f3c2e9.md`
`PromotionReason`: `NONE` `AuditTarget`: `NONE` `BlockedOn`: `NONE`

`BaselineReconciliation`: `NONE`

## Handoff

`Kind`: `FAILURE` `From`: `TESTING` `FailureType`: `ARCHITECTURE` `Reason`:
`Retry behavior is not defined by the current technical design.`

## Recovery

`Active`: `true`

### Frame 1

`From`: `TESTING` `Owner`: `ARCHITECTING` `FailureType`: `ARCHITECTURE`
`Reason`: `Retry behavior is not defined by the current technical design.`
`ResumeAt`: `TESTING` `RerunThrough`: `NONE`

## Outstanding Obligations

`Active`: `false`
```

### Branches and merges

Commit `.standards/` like any other project files. `STATE.md` belongs to the
branch it is committed on, and each branch carries at most one active cycle,
which anyone who checks out the branch continues where it was left.

- To start over on a branch, including one created from a branch with an active
  cycle, the user cancels the cycle or runs **Project Reset**.
- Once a branch's cycle is signed off or cancelled, the user runs **Project
  Reset** on it before merging it into the main branch. The main branch then
  keeps a fresh installation with an accurate `MODE.md` instead of one branch's
  workflow state, Auditor context, and cycle records, and every branch created
  from it starts with no cycle.

Merging two branches that both changed `.standards/` without a reset usually
conflicts in `STATE.md`. The user resolves it by keeping exactly one cycle; the
other cycle stops being tracked, and its records stay under `.standards/docs/`
for the user to decide about. While `.standards/` has unmerged files or conflict
markers, a workflow role stops, tells the user which cycles are involved, and
waits; it never resolves the conflict by choosing a side.

### Manual edits

STANDARDS changes its runtime files and cycle records only through legal
protocol transitions and the runtime tools. Editing them by hand is unsupported,
except to resolve a merge conflict as described above; a user who edits them
otherwise is responsible for the result. `check` reports many, but not all, of
the problems such edits cause.

## Navigator Boundary

Navigator helps the user understand existing work, investigate questions, and
check comprehension. It may run in any workflow state, including user-owned and
terminal states, with any cycle mode or no active cycle. It owns no workflow
state or persisted artifact and has no workflow completion gate.

- Navigator persists nothing. It creates no quiz scores, preferences, or
  summaries, and conversation context stays in the conversation.
- The control-plane permissions elsewhere in this protocol do not apply while
  Navigator runs. It never initializes cycles, generates IDs, records blockers,
  selects or promotes cycle modes, signs off, cancels, or creates failure,
  recovery, or other state-changing handoffs. It may explain these actions and
  their owners, but performing them requires leaving Navigator.

The Navigator skill defines the full operating boundary, including its
non-mutation rules, diagnostic safety requirements, explanation standards, and
interaction modes.

## Instruction Layering and Conflicts

Role-specific precedence may order **compatible** guidance, such as applying a
repository formatter before generic style preferences. Precedence must never be
used to silently resolve a material conflict among the protocol or installed
integration contract, explicit user constraints, completed role-owned workflow
artifacts, project-specific instructions, or repository-enforced/toolchain
constraints.

When authorities materially conflict:

1. If the conflict is a defect or changed requirement owned by a workflow role,
   route it through the protocol's normal failure, recovery, or `USER_REWORK`
   mechanics to that owner.
2. If no workflow owner can resolve the contradiction without overriding another
   authority, or project instructions conflict with the protocol/integration
   contract, stop workflow work and require user resolution.
3. Do not weaken an authority, invent an exception, or choose a winner merely
   because one source appears earlier in a role-specific precedence list.

Role skills should reference these rules rather than redefine conflict-resolution
semantics locally.

## Runtime Tools and Hooks

Installation places these tools in `.standards/bin/`. They run with Node.js.
Roles use them instead of doing these steps by hand:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `node .standards/bin/cycle.mjs new --request "<request>"` | Generate a new cycle ID (see **Cycle IDs**). |
| `node .standards/bin/artifact.mjs init <TYPE>` | Create one of the active cycle's records with its provenance block and header (see **Workflow Artifact Provenance**). |
| `node .standards/bin/id.mjs next <AC\|DEV\|F\|D\|DOC> <file>` | Print the next free identifier for a record. |
| `node .standards/bin/check.mjs` | Check the runtime files and the active cycle's records. It only reads files. |

A workflow role runs `check` before its first substantive work and again before
every state-changing handoff. For each problem it reports:

1. If the problem is in work the current role owns, fix it before continuing.
2. If another role owns it, route it through **Failure Handoffs**.
3. If no role can fix it, for example a merge conflict or a hand-edited file,
   stop and report it to the user.

A forward handoff requires that `check` reports no problem in files the current
role owns. `check` finds mechanical errors such as malformed cycle IDs, broken
provenance, or missing acceptance coverage; it does not replace a role's
completion gate. If a tool is missing or fails, stop and report it; do not do
its step by hand.

Installation can also add a stop hook for Claude Code and Codex (see
**Installed Runtime Contract**). When an agent finishes a turn and workflow
files have uncommitted changes, the stop hook runs `check`. If it finds
problems, it sends the agent back once with the list, and the agent handles them
as described above. Because the turn may have ended with a handoff, the hook
does not hold the current state's own `COMPLETE` records to full acceptance
coverage; the role that owns the state reconciles them when it starts, and its
own `check` before handing off still includes them. During recovery, when
`check` otherwise holds only the current state's `COMPLETE` records, the hook
instead holds those of the state named in `Handoff.From` after a `FORWARD`,
`RESUME`, or `FAILURE` handoff, which that state's role made with its records
current. It holds none while in `SCOPING`, because Scoper may have changed the
acceptance conditions since that handoff.

Navigator may run `check`, because it changes nothing. When `check` or a hook
reports problems during Navigator work, Navigator reports them and changes
nothing.

## Forward Transitions

A forward transition occurs only after the current state's completion gate
passes.

### Standard Greenfield

```text
SCOPING
-> ARCHITECTING
-> AUDITING
-> DEVELOPING
-> TESTING
-> REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION
-> DOCUMENTING
-> REVIEWING_FINAL
-> SYNCHRONIZING
-> AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF
```

### Standard Brownfield

```text
AUDITING
-> SCOPING
-> ARCHITECTING
-> DEVELOPING
-> TESTING
-> REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION
-> DOCUMENTING
-> REVIEWING_FINAL
-> SYNCHRONIZING
-> AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF
```

For brownfield standard work, `ARCHITECTING -> DEVELOPING` requires valid
project context for the active cycle. Missing, materially incomplete, incorrect,
or unexpectedly invalidated context routes to `AUDITING`. Planned active-cycle
implementation changes do not alone make context stale.

### Expedited Brownfield

```text
DEVELOPING
-> REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION
-> AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF
```

This topology is valid only for `ProjectMode: BROWNFIELD` with
`CycleMode: EXPEDITED`, under **Expedited Cycle Contract**.

## Handoff Rules

1. Forward handoff requires the current completion gate to pass.
2. A role does not repair work it does not own; failures route under **Failure
   Handoffs**.
3. A handoff identifies its target role or workflow state. A failure handoff
   also identifies `FailureType`; `REVIEW` targets the Reviewer state matching
   the affected `ReviewKind`.
4. No role silently changes another role's artifact or decision.
5. Corrective routing and reruns follow **Recovery Mechanics**, which skills
   must not redefine; user decisions follow **User Decisions and
   Intervention**; and promotion follows **Expedited Promotion** and is not
   encoded as `FAILURE`.
6. Every state-changing transition persists all applicable `WorkflowState`,
   `CycleMode`, pending-cycle, `Active Work`, `Handoff`, `Recovery`, and
   `Outstanding Obligations` changes before further role work and before
   presenting any next-role invocation.
7. After a legal transition to a different workflow role, provide a concise
   copy/paste invocation for that role unless the same user instruction already
   explicitly invoked it and it will continue immediately. Do not emit one when
   the workflow remains with the same role, a blocking question is unresolved,
   the result is `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, `SIGNED_OFF`, or `CANCELLED`, or
   Navigator is used.
8. The invocation is convenience only; `STATE.md` and role-owned artifacts
   remain authoritative. Use the active client's syntax and avoid duplicating
   authoritative workflow content unless needed for disambiguation:

```text
Next role: <Role>

Codex:       $<skill> Continue the active workflow from `.standards/STATE.md`. Read the persisted Active Work, relevant project context and owned artifacts, and recovery context before proceeding.
Claude Code: /<skill> Continue the active workflow from `.standards/STATE.md`. Read the persisted Active Work, relevant project context and owned artifacts, and recovery context before proceeding.
```

Emit only the active-client line. When recovery is active, replace “active
workflow” with “active recovery” and explicitly direct the role to read the
active recovery frame.

At `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, present the applicable user actions rather than a
next-role invocation.

### Independent Assessment Sessions

Tester and Reviewer reconstruct assessments from persisted artifacts and
repository evidence. Before a handoff to either role, persist the applicable
state, owned artifacts, claims, assessed content identities, actual commands and
results, limitations, unresolved findings and dependencies, and resume context.
Record detail in the owning artifact, not in `Handoff.Reason`. The receiving
role must be able to work without the authoring conversation.

Every handoff entering `TESTING`, `REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION`, or
`REVIEWING_FINAL`, including recovery and corrections, keeps the normal
invocation with its persisted-input and recovery-frame directions, adds the
fresh-session prefix below, and names the review kind when entering Reviewer.
Even when the user invoked both roles together, the immediate-continuation
exception never runs an assessment in a conversation that contains the
prohibited authoring history.

A skill cannot erase chat history or certify session freshness without client
support. Known prohibited history requires persisting missing context within
existing ownership, then stopping before the formal assessment to request a
fresh session. When history or client metadata is unavailable, state that
limitation and proceed from persisted evidence, without inventing an
attestation, blocking automatically, or asking for routine confirmation. The
assessing role may resume its own interrupted assessment in a conversation
separate from the prohibited authoring work.

### Independent Tester Session

Apply **Independent Assessment Sessions**. Prefix a Tester invocation with
“Open a fresh chat separate from Developer's implementation conversation, then
run:”. Developer implementation history is prohibited for formal Tester work.

### Independent Reviewer Session

Apply **Independent Assessment Sessions**. Prefix a Reviewer invocation with
“Open a fresh chat separate from the conversations that produced the artifacts
under review, then run:”. The separation covers requirements, design, context,
implementation, tests and evidence, and documentation authoring, not just
Developer. Reviewer's own review history, including resuming its assessment and
correcting its own findings, is not prohibited history.

Also recommend that the user select a different model of equal or higher
capability than the one that produced the work, where known. This is advisory:
do not switch models automatically, guess model identities or capability
rankings, or add a routine author-model confirmation gate. Unknown model
metadata is a stated limitation, not a blocker, and session separation is
required even when no different model is available.

## Commit Message Guidance

After role work, if the role produced a meaningful atomic set of repository
changes, provide a suggested Git commit message. Do not create the commit unless
the user explicitly requests it. Coordination-only changes such as advancing
`STATE.md` do not justify a suggestion by themselves.

Use Conventional Commits, `<type>(<optional-scope>): <description>`, for
example `feat(search): implement user search` or `docs(scope): define user
search requirements`. Choose type and scope from the actual changes, not the
role or workflow state. Common types include `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`,
`refactor`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`, and `chore`. Keep the description concise,
imperative, and specific. Use breaking-change syntax or footers only for
genuinely breaking changes.

`NAVIGATOR` never suggests a commit. Other roles omit the suggestion when they
produced no meaningful committable changes. When both a commit suggestion and a
next-role invocation are emitted, present the commit suggestion first.

## Acceptance Traceability

These obligations apply only to `STANDARD` cycles and do not create a shared
traceability artifact or add acceptance data to `STATE.md`. `EXPEDITED` cycles
do not fabricate Scoper-owned acceptance conditions or substitute identifiers.
If an expedited cycle is promoted, Scoper establishes them when the standard
topology reaches `SCOPING`.

1. Scoper represents every verifiable in-scope completion obligation as one or
   more acceptance conditions with stable, unique `AC-NNN` identifiers for the
   active cycle. Do not combine separable obligations under one identifier when
   their satisfaction or verification evidence is established in different
   workflow phases. The identifier is a reference, not an ordering guarantee.
   Get each new identifier with `node .standards/bin/id.mjs next AC <scope>`.
   Define each condition as a Markdown list item, bulleted or numbered, that
   starts with its identifier followed by a colon or dash, for example
   ``- `AC-001`: Users can search by name.`` A table row, heading, or prose
   mention does not define a condition, and `check` reports an identifier the
   scope mentions without defining. This applies to a reused project scope
   document too: write its current conditions in this form.
2. During REPLAN, preserve an identifier when meaning is unchanged. New or
   materially replaced conditions receive previously unused identifiers.
   Removed or replaced identifiers remain in the scope's retired-identifier
   record: list items in the same form under a
   `## Retired Acceptance Identifiers` heading. Never renumber surviving
   identifiers or reuse retired ones within the cycle.
3. When a cycle reuses a canonical scope document that already holds another
   cycle's acceptance conditions, numbering continues from the highest
   identifier ever used in that document. Move the earlier cycle's conditions,
   including its retired identifiers, under a `## Previous Cycles` heading that
   stays the document's last section; the moved content may keep its own
   headings. Everything under that heading is history, not current
   obligations, and its identifiers are never used again in that document.
4. Scoper owns acceptance wording and meaning. Downstream roles reference IDs
   but do not redefine intent; material defects route to Scoper.
5. Architect accounts for every current ID with technical design coverage or an
   explicit no-architectural-impact disposition when satisfaction depends
   entirely on established nontechnical behavior or work owned by another
   workflow phase. Group IDs only when the same disposition applies; do not
   invent architecture or claim ownership of satisfaction that belongs to
   another workflow phase. When a cycle reuses a canonical design document that
   already holds another cycle's acceptance coverage or technical acceptance
   criteria, move them under a `## Previous Cycles` heading that stays the
   document's last section, as in rule 3, before adding the current coverage.
   Everything under that heading is history, not current coverage or criteria.
6. All downstream coverage, work, and evidence references the same current IDs;
   downstream roles do not invent substitute requirement IDs.
7. Tester accounts for every current ID with verification evidence, a blocker,
   or—when satisfaction explicitly depends on a later role—a pending dependency.
   Pending is not verification evidence and must be resolved downstream under
   the same ID.
8. `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF` is forbidden while any current ID lacks sufficient
   evidence or has an unresolved blocker. Route defects to their owning roles
   through normal failure and recovery rules; never treat an unevidenced
   condition as satisfied by assumption.
9. Acceptance changes during recovery or rework invalidate any completed
   downstream artifact whose completion contract requires accounting for every
   current ID. Include those states when computing downstream invalidation even
   if underlying behavior or technical decisions remain otherwise valid.

## Review Kinds

```text
ReviewKind
- IMPLEMENTATION
- FINAL_DELIVERABLE
```

`IMPLEMENTATION` corresponds to `REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION`.
`FINAL_DELIVERABLE` corresponds to `REVIEWING_FINAL`. A review handoff must
identify the requested kind.

### Review Gates

Critical, independent assessment is required in both review kinds. Scope and
architecture are authoritative statements of intended behavior, not proof that
those statements are consistent or complete. Reviewer examines relevant claims
from all roles and repository evidence without inheriting completion conclusions
or silently replacing owned decisions.

`IMPLEMENTATION` assesses implementation against the active contract, upstream
consistency, Developer claims, and, in `STANDARD`, Tester coverage and evidence.
Account for every current `AC-NNN` and relevant technical criterion. Explicit
later-phase dependencies may remain only when satisfaction belongs to that later
role; record the owner, required evidence, and the same AC ID. Pending is not
evidence and cannot defer a present-phase defect or verification gap.

`FINAL_DELIVERABLE` is available only in `STANDARD`. It assesses the assembled
work after documentation: current acceptance evidence, documentation accuracy,
unresolved findings, and consistency across artifacts. Every current acceptance
condition and relevant technical criterion must have sufficient current evidence;
unresolved dependencies or material evidence gaps cannot pass this gate.

In `EXPEDITED`, implementation review assesses the bounded `Active Work.Request`
and Developer evidence under **Expedited Cycle Contract**. Do not demand
intentionally skipped artifacts, fabricate acceptance IDs, perform final review,
or claim skipped guarantees. Promote when an omitted guarantee becomes necessary.

A review passes only when no unresolved material finding or material assessment
gap remains, no blocking user question or obligation owned by the current review
state remains, and the applicable gate above is satisfied. No material findings
is a valid outcome; there is no finding quota. A report with no established
defects but insufficient material evidence is still incomplete. Reviewer defines
severity and evidence details in its shared procedure and report template.

Passing a review gate does not complete the cycle. Apply **Recovery Mechanics**
when active; otherwise follow **Forward Transitions**. Before entering
`AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, all applicable cycle completion requirements, including
an empty recovery stack and inactive outstanding obligations, must hold.

## Synchronization Gate

Synchronizer reconciles completed assessments, the current deliverable, and
workflow records in `SYNCHRONIZING` during `STANDARD` only. Reviewer owns the
assessment of soundness; Synchronizer establishes whether that assessment and
its supporting evidence still apply to the work being offered for sign-off.
Initial work, resumption, and reconciliation after corrections share this full
completion gate. A corrective return below does not declare this gate passed.

Synchronization passes when:

- the current-cycle synchronization record has matching provenance and current
  assessed input identities, with references to the existing completion and
  evidence artifacts;
- cycle identities, artifact references, current files, and completion claims
  agree, and implementation and final review conclusions remain applicable;
- every current acceptance condition and relevant technical criterion has
  sufficient current evidence under **Acceptance Traceability**, including
  evidence resolving any earlier later-role dependencies under the same IDs;
- no unresolved material discrepancy or reconciliation gap remains, and no
  blocking user question or obligation owned by `SYNCHRONIZING` remains;
- limitations, remaining work, and a concise conclusion with resume/handoff
  context are persisted. A sufficiently assessed no-change result is valid.

The record references evidence; it is not another authoritative acceptance
ledger. File presence or a `COMPLETE` label alone proves neither completion nor
continued applicability. Synchronizer owns its record and corrections to its
reconciliation, not another role's evidence, findings, or completion markers.

Project-facing documentation and agent guidance are Documenter-owned, including
project instructions outside managed framework blocks. Their completion evidence
must identify the relevant documents and assessed content, checks performed and
results or limits, and any current AC or technical criterion they satisfy.
Documenter persists this evidence and resumable progress in its documentation
record under **Workflow Artifact Provenance**, referencing supporting evidence
where it already exists rather than copying it. The record also preserves
collaboration mode, target and editing boundary, explicitly selected user style
(or `NONE`), remaining work, discrepancies, dependencies, and the completion
conclusion. It is not an authoritative acceptance ledger and does not certify
another role's work. Reviewer and Synchronizer consume it independently; neither
manufactures its evidence or rewrites documentation. Managed framework blocks,
installed protocol, and installation metadata retain installer/protocol ownership.
Preserve user-authored instructions and apply **Instruction Layering and
Conflicts** when necessary.

Passing this gate is not cycle completion or user acceptance. Apply **Recovery
Mechanics** after owned correction and the gate: an active recovery stack does
not by itself prevent the Synchronizer gate from passing. A correction or rerun
may need to return to `ResumeAt` instead of advancing toward sign-off.

## Standard Cycle Completion

Before a `STANDARD` cycle enters `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, all applicable
standard role gates must be satisfied for the current work, including final
review and synchronization. Every current AC and relevant technical criterion
must have sufficient current evidence, with no unresolved material findings,
discrepancies, dependencies, or blocking user question. Required project context
must be valid and `Active Work.BaselineReconciliation` must be `NONE`.
Recovery must be complete (empty stack) and outstanding obligations inactive.
Apply recovery routing first; neither a report label nor correction of one
owned obligation bypasses these requirements.

`AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF` means ready for the user's decision, not accepted or
`SIGNED_OFF`. User acceptance follows **User Decisions and Intervention**;
revalidate these requirements at sign-off against current inputs. `EXPEDITED`
uses **Expedited Cycle Contract** instead and never fabricates synchronization.

| `SYNCHRONIZATION` | `SYNCHRONIZER` |

The discoverer of a failure does not automatically own the fix. Route it to the
owner of the defective artifact or decision.

## Failure Handoffs

A failure handoff routes a defect to its owning state:

```text
SCOPING failure         -> SCOPING
ARCHITECTURE failure    -> ARCHITECTING
PROJECT_CONTEXT failure -> AUDITING
IMPLEMENTATION failure  -> DEVELOPING
VERIFICATION failure    -> TESTING
DOCUMENTATION failure   -> DOCUMENTING
REVIEW failure          -> REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION or REVIEWING_FINAL, matching the affected review
SYNCHRONIZATION failure -> SYNCHRONIZING
```

In `STANDARD`, use this routing directly. In `EXPEDITED`, only
`IMPLEMENTATION -> DEVELOPING` and implementation `REVIEW ->
REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION` are valid failure routes because only those states
exist in the expedited topology. A defect or guarantee owned by a skipped role
requires **Expedited Promotion**, not a failure transition into a skipped state.

If routing changes state, apply **Recovery Mechanics**. A same-state failure
records the handoff but does not create a recovery frame.

## Recovery Mechanics

This is the canonical recovery algorithm. Skills define only how their role
corrects its owned work, evaluates its completion gate, and identifies which
previously completed downstream states its correction invalidates.

Recovery follows the active `CycleMode` topology. Expedited recovery reruns only
expedited states; a newly required skipped role or guarantee triggers
**Expedited Promotion**, which preserves unresolved corrective obligations as
`Outstanding Obligations` and clears only the now-obsolete expedited recovery
routing.

1. **Push only when corrective routing changes state.** For `FAILURE` or
   `USER_REWORK` moving to a different state, push a frame with `From` =
   interrupted state, `Owner` = corrective target, applicable `FailureType` and
   `Reason`, `ResumeAt` = interrupted state, and `RerunThrough: NONE`.
   Same-state correction creates no frame.
2. **Preserve nesting.** New failure or rework during recovery pushes another
   frame. Never overwrite older frames. The last frame is active.
3. **Only the active frame owner plans resumption.** After correcting the defect
   and passing its normal gate, that owner decides whether previously completed
   downstream states must be re-established before `ResumeAt`. The only
   exceptions are **Documenter Corrective Return** and **Synchronizer Corrective
   Return**. Their conditions allow the respective owner to plan resumption
   without declaring its full gate passed; the routing algorithm below remains
   unchanged.
4. **No rerun:** pop the frame and transition directly to `ResumeAt` with
   `Handoff.Kind: RESUME`.
5. **Rerun required:** set `RerunThrough` to the last required state and
   transition to the earliest required rerun state. Keep the frame on the
   stack.
6. **Rerun states use normal gates and legal forward handoffs** while preserving
   the stack. They do not own the frame unless a nested defect creates a new one.
7. **At the rerun boundary**, after `RerunThrough` passes its gate, pop the frame
   and transition to `ResumeAt` with `Handoff.Kind: RESUME` instead of taking
   the normal forward handoff. This explicit return is valid even when
   `ResumeAt` lies outside the project's normal forward topology.
8. Recovery ends only when the stack is empty.

Examples:

```text
Architecture defect discovered during testing:
TESTING -> ARCHITECTING                 # push frame, ResumeAt TESTING
ARCHITECTING -> DEVELOPING              # set RerunThrough DEVELOPING
DEVELOPING -> TESTING                   # boundary completes, pop, resume TESTING

Scoping defect discovered during implementation review:
REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION -> SCOPING     # push frame
SCOPING -> ARCHITECTING                 # set RerunThrough TESTING
ARCHITECTING -> DEVELOPING -> TESTING
TESTING -> REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION     # pop, explicit resume

Invalid project context discovered during architecture:
ARCHITECTING -> AUDITING                # push frame
AUDITING -> ARCHITECTING                # no rerun; pop and resume

Nested recovery:
TESTING -> AUDITING                     # outer frame, ResumeAt TESTING
AUDITING -> SCOPING                     # nested rework frame, ResumeAt AUDITING
SCOPING -> ARCHITECTING                 # set nested RerunThrough DEVELOPING
ARCHITECTING -> DEVELOPING
DEVELOPING -> AUDITING                  # pop nested frame, explicit resume
```

### Corrective Returns

An interrupted role may need a documentation or reconciliation defect corrected
before it can finish its own work, and requiring the correcting role to finish
its full gate first would stop both. Documenter and Synchronizer may therefore
plan resumption without passing their full gate. This is a narrow recovery
outcome in `STANDARD`, not another mode or a passing completion conclusion, and
it applies only when:

- the correcting role owns the active recovery frame, whose `RerunThrough` is
  `NONE`, and `ResumeAt` is another workflow role's state, not a user-owned
  state;
- its record has valid current-cycle provenance, and the frame's specific
  correction has been verified as its subsection below requires;
- every remaining full-gate gap exists only because work or assessment already
  assigned to the interrupted role or the preserved recovery route is
  unfinished. Record each remaining item, its owner, and the evidence still
  required;
- any newly discovered independent defect or gap is handled through normal
  failure and blocking rules instead of being deferred by this exception.

Persist the correction evidence and remaining work, leaving the record
`IN_PROGRESS` or `BLOCKED` while its full gate is unmet. Then use **Recovery
Mechanics** to determine reruns and the return, preserving older frames and
outstanding obligations. Do not mark the record `COMPLETE`, claim the gate
passed, close another role's findings, or take a normal forward handoff on the
strength of the correction. A same-state correction, a downstream rerun that
does not own the active frame, or a return to `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF` cannot use
this exception. The full gate still applies before a normal forward handoff,
and **Standard Cycle Completion** still requires completed documentation and
full synchronization before sign-off readiness.

#### Documenter Corrective Return

Applies in `DOCUMENTING` to a documentation or project-guidance defect, in
addition to the shared conditions of **Corrective Returns**. The correction must
be verified in saved content against current inputs with sufficient actual
evidence, and no unverified corrective edit, unresolved actionable documentation
defect, Documenter-owned outstanding obligation, or blocking user question may
remain. For each remaining item, also persist its prerequisite and when
documentation must be revisited, and persist the correction's applicability
limits and resume context. Preserve current AC references where they exist; do
not fabricate future scope, design, implementation, verification, or review
artifacts, or acceptance identifiers. Missing evidence needed to verify the
correction, independent defects or gaps, and currently actionable documentation
outside a selected editing boundary follow normal failure and blocking rules; a
selected target or collaboration mode waives none of these conditions. GUIDED
work must have an inspected saved correction; supplying a snippet is
insufficient. On re-entry, reconcile current inputs and the retained work.

#### Synchronizer Corrective Return

Applies in `SYNCHRONIZING` to a Synchronizer-owned reconciliation error, in
addition to the shared conditions of **Corrective Returns**. The correction
must be verified against current inputs, and no unresolved
Synchronizer-owned defect, obligation, or blocking question may prevent that
corrective outcome. An open Reviewer finding awaiting reassessment of this
correction remains Reviewer-owned.

## Expedited Cycle Contract

An `EXPEDITED` cycle provides a deliberately narrower completion contract:

1. It is valid only in `BROWNFIELD`, and only while the request is a
   sufficiently bounded implementation contract and no omitted role or guarantee
   is required.
2. `Active Work.Request` is the change contract. `Scope` and `Architecture`
   remain `NONE` unless promotion later causes their owners to create them.
3. Existing project context may be consulted as prior evidence but is not
   refreshed by default. Prior-cycle non-baseline entries are stale for the
   current cycle.
4. Active-cycle implementation remains tentative and does not become
   established baseline, even after promotion.
5. Developer owns implementation and normal implementation-level self-checks;
   these are not Tester-owned formal verification.
6. Reviewer still owns `REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION` and may route implementation
   defects through normal recovery.
7. Scoper, Architect, Auditor, Tester, Documenter, `REVIEWING_FINAL`, and
   Synchronizer are absent from the expedited forward topology. Their missing
   artifacts or gates are not failures. Skipping them transfers none of their
   ownership, artifacts, or completion guarantees to Developer or Reviewer, and
   neither synthesizes the skipped work.
8. The cycle may reach `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF` after Developer and implementation
   Reviewer pass their gates, recovery is empty, and no blocking user question
   remains. Scope-level acceptance traceability does not apply.
9. If safe completion requires an omitted role or guarantee, including baseline
   status that needs Auditor-owned context, use **Expedited Promotion** instead
   of assigning that work to Developer, weakening ownership, or fabricating
   skipped work.

## Expedited Promotion

Promotion changes a nonterminal `EXPEDITED` brownfield cycle to `STANDARD` when
safe completion requires formal Scoping, consequential Architecture,
authoritative Auditor-owned context, Tester-owned verification, Documentation,
Final Review, Synchronization, or another intentionally omitted guarantee. It is
a topology change, not a failure handoff, and it is one-way for the active
cycle.

1. An active workflow role may promote when required. At
   `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, user authorization is required. An explicit promote
   request qualifies; so does an explicit rework request whose changed contract
   necessarily requires an omitted standard role or guarantee.
2. Set `CycleMode: STANDARD`, `WorkflowState: AUDITING`, and
   `Handoff.Kind: PROMOTE`; set `From` to the interrupted state,
   `FailureType: NONE`, and record a concise reason identifying which omitted
   standard guarantee is now required. Persist the same reason in
   `Active Work.PromotionReason`.
3. Preserve cycle `Id`, the current `Request` (including a change made by the
   rework that authorized promotion), and role-owned artifacts. Do not fabricate
   `Scope` or `Architecture`.
4. Auditor establishes or refreshes context without laundering tentative
   expedited work into pre-existing baseline. It distinguishes pre-cycle
   baseline from active-cycle changes using authoritative evidence, and material
   ambiguity requires a user question rather than a guess.
5. Before clearing recovery, persist the frame-to-obligation conversion defined
   in **Outstanding Obligations** under **Workflow State Reference**, preserving
   each converted frame's `Owner`, `FailureType`, and `Reason`. Then
   clear the expedited recovery stack; the standard brownfield topology restarts
   at `AUDITING`.
6. All standard forward, failure, recovery, outstanding-obligation,
   traceability, and sign-off rules apply afterward.

## User Decisions and Intervention

These are user-authorized control-plane transitions, subject to **Navigator
Boundary**. An explicit, unambiguous user instruction may authorize the receiving
agent to persist the coordination change regardless of current state ownership.
That authorizes only the coordination changes the applicable rule below
requires, not the target role's work: resulting role-owned work may proceed only
when that role was explicitly invoked and owns the resulting state. Otherwise
stop after persisting the transition and provide the next-role invocation when
the handoff rules require one.

At `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, available actions are sign off, rework, or cancel;
for expedited work, explicit promotion is also available. Bounded expedited
rework follows normal recovery back to sign-off. Rework requiring a skipped
standard guarantee promotes and restarts the standard brownfield topology at
`AUDITING`.

### Choose the next cycle's mode

While no cycle is active, or before the initialized first cycle has received its
request, an explicit user instruction may set `PendingCycleMode` to a mode
supported by the current `ProjectMode`, replace an earlier pending preference,
or clear it to `UNSET`. Leave `CycleMode: UNSET` and `Active Work` unchanged;
the selection does not activate a cycle. The latest selection survives across
sessions until a cycle consumes it or the user replaces or clears it. While a
blocked `PendingCycleRequest` exists, a mode change or clear revalidates that
request under **Start a cycle** without asking the user to repeat it.

### Start a cycle

A cycle starts from the installed state, where `Active Work.Id`,
`Active Work.Request`, and `CycleMode` are `UNSET`, or from `SIGNED_OFF` or
retained `CANCELLED`; a finished cycle is never reopened. The request is the
user's new request or, when one exists, the persisted `PendingCycleRequest`: use
it without asking the user to restate it, and let a revised request replace it.

1. **Determine the reconciliation obligation** the new cycle would carry,
   without writing it yet. For the first cycle and from `SIGNED_OFF`, it is
   `NONE`. From retained `CANCELLED`, it preserves any existing
   `BaselineReconciliation` and, unless the user explicitly confirms that the
   just-cancelled cycle left no project changes because none were produced or
   they were reverted, adds a `SourceCycle`/`Request` entry for that cycle under
   **Baseline Reconciliation Format** if its exact cycle ID is not already
   listed.
2. **Choose the mode before changing any state.** A pending preference must be
   valid for the request, the current `ProjectMode`, and the reconciliation
   obligation; a pending `STANDARD` preference also prevents Developer from
   inferring `EXPEDITED`. Without a pending preference, `STANDARD` is the
   default, except that in `BROWNFIELD` an explicit Developer invocation with a
   sufficiently bounded implementation request may select `EXPEDITED`.
   `GREENFIELD` supports only `STANDARD`, and unresolved reconciliation requires
   `STANDARD`. A pending `EXPEDITED` preference does not bypass the
   **Expedited Cycle Contract**: validate eligibility before consuming it.
3. **Block instead of starting when the mode is not legal**, whether because of
   an invalid pending preference or an explicitly requested mode the current
   `ProjectMode` does not support. Never silently reinterpret the mode as
   `STANDARD` or persist an unsupported mode. Leave `WorkflowState`,
   `Active Work`, `CycleMode`, and `PendingCycleMode` unchanged; persist the
   request in `PendingCycleRequest` and the specific decision required in
   `PendingCycleBlockedOn`, not in `Active Work.BlockedOn`; and ask the user to
   choose a supported mode, replace or clear the preference, revise the request,
   or abandon it. Abandoning clears `PendingCycleRequest` and
   `PendingCycleBlockedOn` without modifying `Active Work` or starting a cycle.
4. **Generate the ID** as **Cycle IDs** describes. If the tool refuses, leave
   the state unchanged and do not start the cycle.
5. **Persist the cycle** in one state update:
   - `Active Work`: the new ID and request; `Scope`, `Architecture`,
     `Development`, `PromotionReason`, `AuditTarget`, and `BlockedOn` set to
     `NONE`; and `BaselineReconciliation` from step 1.
   - `CycleMode`: the chosen mode. `PendingCycleMode` and `PendingCycleRequest`
     become `UNSET`, and `PendingCycleBlockedOn` becomes `NONE`.
   - `Handoff`: for the first cycle, keep `Kind: INITIAL` with `From: NONE` and
     `FailureType: NONE`; from a terminal state, record `Kind: NEW_CYCLE`,
     `From` set to that state, `FailureType: NONE`, and a concise reason. An
     expedited first cycle records a concise expedited-entry reason. Mention an
     unresolved reconciliation obligation concisely, without copying its
     source-cycle provenance.
   - Recovery and outstanding obligations inactive.
   - `WorkflowState`: `AUDITING` when reconciliation is unresolved or
     cancelled-cycle changes are being retained or adopted, so Auditor
     establishes baseline status first. Otherwise `DEVELOPING` for an allowed
     `EXPEDITED` cycle, or the standard entry state for the current
     `ProjectMode`: `SCOPING` for `GREENFIELD` or `AUDITING` for
     `BROWNFIELD`.

`CycleMode` never remains `UNSET` once a cycle has started.

### Promote an expedited cycle

An explicit user instruction may authorize **Expedited Promotion** from any
nonterminal expedited brownfield state, including `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`.
After persisting promotion, stop and hand off to Auditor unless Auditor was also
explicitly invoked.

### Rework an active cycle

From any nonterminal state, update `Active Work.Request` when the request
changed, identify the earliest owned artifact or decision invalidated, record
`Handoff.Kind: USER_REWORK` with its `FailureType`, and route to that owner. If
state changes, push the recovery frame defined by **Recovery Mechanics** with
`ResumeAt` equal to the interrupted state; preserve older frames. User-requested
changes are not agent-discovered failures.

In `EXPEDITED`, bounded implementation rework routes to `DEVELOPING`. If the new
contract requires a skipped standard role or guarantee, the rework request
itself authorizes promotion: update `Active Work.Request` to the changed
contract, then apply **Expedited Promotion** instead of routing to
`DEVELOPING`. Record `Handoff.Kind: PROMOTE`, not `USER_REWORK`, and push no
rework frame.

### Sign off

From `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, sign-off is legal only when the
`Outstanding Obligations` section is inactive. Revalidate the current mode's
completion contract: **Standard Cycle Completion**, including every standard
gate and the acceptance-traceability obligations, or, for `EXPEDITED`, only the
narrower **Expedited Cycle Contract**; skipped standard phases must not be
represented as completed. Then transition to `SIGNED_OFF`, set
`CycleMode: UNSET`, leave all pending-cycle fields clear, record
`Handoff.Kind: SIGNOFF`, `From: AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, and `FailureType: NONE`,
and clear recovery. The cycle is complete.

### Cancel an active cycle

- If `ProjectMode: GREENFIELD`, follow **Greenfield Bootstrap Cancellation**,
  including explicit approval of the reset before it runs.
- If `ProjectMode: BROWNFIELD`, transition to `CANCELLED`, set
  `CycleMode: UNSET`, leave all pending-cycle fields clear, record
  `Handoff.Kind: CANCEL`, set `From` to the
  interrupted state, `FailureType: NONE`, preserve `Active Work`, and clear
  recovery plus outstanding obligations. Residual project-change provenance is
  handled through `BaselineReconciliation` when a later cycle starts.

Cancellation never reverts project artifacts and does not by itself establish
cancelled-cycle project changes as baseline.

### Greenfield Bootstrap Cancellation

If cancellation occurs while `ProjectMode` is still `GREENFIELD`, first verify
that the active cycle has not successfully created or materially modified a
project implementation artifact, regardless of authorship. If it has, persist
the permanent `BROWNFIELD` transition and use retained brownfield `CANCELLED`
semantics instead, even if recovery has moved to an earlier workflow state. Only
when no such implementation exists is cancellation a reset of the workflow
rather than a reusable terminal cycle.

The agent performs the reset with **Project Reset**, following **Running the
CLI**:

1. Use `standards reset` if a globally installed STANDARDS CLI has the version
   recorded in `.standards/VERSION.json`; otherwise use
   `npx @idinsight/standards@<that version> reset`.
2. Preview it with `--dry-run`, which may run before approval. Also warn that
   the reset deletes the saved workflow state, the Auditor's project context,
   and every cycle record under `.standards/docs/`, and that the skills, hooks,
   client settings, and user styles stay installed.
3. Ask for explicit approval to run the exact command with `--yes`. A generic
   cancellation request does not grant it. Record the target, command, and
   pending approval in `Active Work.BlockedOn`, preserving any other unresolved
   questions, and keep the workflow state, cycle mode, recovery, and outstanding
   obligations intact while waiting. Do not record `CANCELLED` or continue role
   work while approval is pending. A resumed chat must resolve the saved
   question; silence or a request to continue is not approval.
4. After approval, recheck bootstrap eligibility and the preview. If
   implementation now exists, persist `BROWNFIELD` and use retained cancellation
   instead. If the target, command, planned changes, or warnings changed, obtain
   fresh approval for the updated preview. Otherwise run the approved command
   with `--yes`; the flag avoids a second CLI prompt and never substitutes for
   user approval.
5. Confirm that the reset succeeded before reporting the cancellation complete.
   Do not edit `STATE.md` afterwards to record it; the fresh state is the
   result.

If approval is declined, clear only the approval question, keep the active
cycle, and report that cancellation was not completed; further role work
requires a user instruction to continue. If a matching CLI is unavailable, the
preview fails, or the reset refuses or fails, stop and report that cancellation
did not complete, including any backups the CLI reports, and do not work around
a refusal by switching commands or by deleting or rewriting the files
yourself. A retry requires a valid preview and approval covering it.

The reset leaves no `CANCELLED` state or cycle record behind, so the next
request starts a first cycle from the fresh state, and it chooses the project
mode again from the project's contents. S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. does not revert the
project working tree; reverting project changes is the user's responsibility.

## Cycle IDs

Every cycle has a unique ID. Get it only from
`node .standards/bin/cycle.mjs new --request "<request>"`. The tool:

1. builds an ID from the request, the UTC time, and eight random hex digits, for
   example `add-user-search-20260927T190146Z-7bef0f04`;
2. checks that no cycle-owned artifact path or STANDARDS provenance block uses
   it; and
3. prints it without changing any file.

It refuses while a cycle is active (`Active Work.Id` is set and the state is not
terminal), when `STATE.md` has a merge conflict, and when `STATE.md` is invalid.
Only after the tool succeeds may the printed ID be written to `Active Work.Id`
and cycle initialization continue. If initialization fails afterwards, run the
tool again for the next attempt; an unused ID needs no cleanup.

Never write a cycle ID yourself or reuse one. `check` reports an
`Active Work.Id` that does not have the generated form, and a cycle that is
active under the ID of a cycle that the last commit ended in `SIGNED_OFF` or
`CANCELLED`: a new cycle always gets a new ID, and a finished cycle is never
reopened.

## Workflow State Reference

This section defines the fields of `.standards/STATE.md` and the rules for
updating them. The subsections follow the order of the shape example in
**Persisted Workflow State**: `Active Work`, `Handoff`, `Recovery`, and
`Outstanding Obligations`.

### Active Work

- `Id`: stable, user-readable identifier generated by `cycle.mjs new` (see
  **Cycle IDs**). It is never reused by another cycle. Never overwrite or
  repurpose an artifact belonging to another cycle.
- `Request`: persisted user request at enough fidelity for the entry role to
  understand the work.
- `Scope`, `Architecture`, and `Development`: repository-relative paths to the
  owning artifacts, or `NONE` until created. Scoper, Architect, and Developer
  must persist their artifact path before their normal completion gate passes.
  In expedited work `Scope` and `Architecture` normally remain `NONE` unless the
  cycle is promoted; `Development` is still Developer-owned and is created before
  implementation begins.
- `PromotionReason`: durable reason an expedited cycle was promoted, otherwise
  `NONE`. Preserve it for the remainder of the cycle; it is workflow context,
  not a user requirement, scope decision, architecture decision, or baseline
  fact.
- `BaselineReconciliation`: durable provenance for unresolved project changes
  retained from cancelled cycles, otherwise `NONE`. It must be resolved before
  the current cycle may rely on the affected repository state as established
  baseline. Use the **Baseline Reconciliation Format** below, with one entry
  per unique `SourceCycle` and its `Request` summary. Carry the list across
  handoffs, failures, rework, recovery, and cancellation until Auditor resolves
  every source and clears it. `Handoff.Reason` is not a substitute.
- `AuditTarget`: transient repository-relative path or area label for an
  in-progress targeted audit when that focus cannot otherwise be recovered from
  persisted active work, owned artifacts, or recovery context; otherwise
  `NONE`. Auditor must persist an ad-hoc user-directed target before relying on
  it and clear it when that targeted audit completes, is abandoned, or no longer
  needs separate persistence.
- `BlockedOn`: unresolved user question preventing completion, otherwise
  `NONE`.

Installation initializes `Id` and `Request` as `UNSET`; **Start a cycle** sets
them for every cycle.

### Baseline Reconciliation Format

Within `Active Work`, store `BaselineReconciliation` on its own line. When no
obligation exists, use exactly:

```markdown
`BaselineReconciliation`: `NONE`
```

Otherwise use a nonempty Markdown list with both required fields in each entry:

```markdown
`BaselineReconciliation`:

- `SourceCycle`: `change-invoice-cache-invalidation-20260923T141500Z-5d2e8b17`
  `Request`: `Change invoice-cache invalidation behavior.`
- `SourceCycle`: `add-internal-notes-to-admin-records-20260924T093000Z-c81f4a06`
  `Request`: `Add internal notes to admin records.`
```

`SourceCycle` is the cancelled source's exact cycle `Id`, not the new cycle's
ID. It is the unique key; `Request` is that source's brief persisted request
summary. Preserve entry order and existing entries when carrying the list into
another cycle. Append a newly obligated source only if its ID is absent; never
replace older sources with the latest cancellation or duplicate an existing ID.
Confirmation that the latest cycle left no changes does not clear older entries.
Keep the complete list while any source remains unresolved; only Auditor clears
it to `NONE` after reconciling every listed source. An empty list is represented
as `NONE`, not an empty string or `[]`.

A value that does not match this format is invalid workflow state. Report the
inconsistency and block work that depends on it until corrected; do not infer
entries or discard obligations.

### Handoff

`Handoff.Kind` is one of `INITIAL`, `FORWARD`, `FAILURE`, `RESUME`, `PROMOTE`,
`USER_REWORK`, `NEW_CYCLE`, `SIGNOFF`, or `CANCEL`. Use `NONE` for inapplicable
fields. `Reason` describes only the latest transition and must remain concise;
it is not durable storage for outstanding recovery or baseline obligations.

Use `RESUME` whenever a recovery frame returns to `ResumeAt`, and for any other
recovery-directed transition that is not the normal forward handoff.

### Recovery

`Recovery` is a stack ordered oldest to newest, and **Recovery Mechanics**
defines how frames are pushed, rerun, and popped. A frame preserves one
corrective defect together with the routing needed to return to interrupted
work. A role owns the active frame only when the current `WorkflowState` equals
its `Owner`; merely running during recovery does not make a role responsible
for the frame.

### Outstanding Obligations

`Outstanding Obligations` preserves unresolved corrective work when the recovery
routing that carried it is no longer valid. It is ordered oldest to newest. Each
obligation records `Owner`, `FailureType`, and `Reason`; it deliberately has no
`From`, `ResumeAt`, or `RerunThrough`.

Normally the recovery frame itself is the durable corrective obligation and no
duplicate outstanding obligation is created. `RerunThrough: NONE` means the
frame's owner has not yet completed its correction; a non-`NONE` `RerunThrough`
means the owner already passed its corrective gate and the frame remains only to
finish downstream rerun/resume routing. During **Expedited Promotion**, convert
each recovery frame whose `RerunThrough` is `NONE` into one outstanding obligation
before clearing the expedited recovery stack. Do not convert frames whose
`RerunThrough` is non-`NONE`. Preserve converted obligations in recovery-stack
order, keep each distinct defect separate, and do not collapse defects merely
because they share an owner or failure type.

When one or more obligations exist, set `Active: true` and record each as a
numbered `### Obligation N` entry containing `Owner`, `FailureType`, and
`Reason`. When an obligation is removed, renumber the remaining entries 1, 2, 3,
... in their existing order. When the last obligation is removed, set
`Active: false` and remove the numbered entries.

An outstanding obligation remains until its owning state is reached and the
owner corrects and verifies the specific defect recorded by the obligation.
Remove a corrected obligation as soon as that corrective outcome is verified;
removing it records only that the obligation itself is satisfied, not that the
owning role is otherwise complete. The owner must still pass its normal
completion gate, including having no unresolved obligation owned by its current
state, before any normal forward handoff. User sign-off is unavailable while any
outstanding obligation remains.

### State-update rules

1. Installation initializes from the selected mode template: `SCOPING` for
   `GREENFIELD`, `AUDITING` for `BROWNFIELD`, `CycleMode: UNSET`,
   `PendingCycleMode: UNSET`, `PendingCycleRequest: UNSET`,
   `PendingCycleBlockedOn: NONE`, `Handoff.Kind: INITIAL`, unset active work,
   and inactive recovery.
2. Every legal state-changing transition updates all applicable fields as
   **Handoff Rules** requires; failure and recovery, promotion, and user-control
   transitions follow their canonical sections.
3. Blocking questions during an active cycle do not change workflow state. Set
   `Active Work.BlockedOn` before asking and clear it after incorporating the
   answer. Pre-cycle control-plane questions must not modify
   `Active Work.BlockedOn`; persist the blocked request and question in
   `PendingCycleRequest` and `PendingCycleBlockedOn` instead.

`STATE.md` coordinates the workflow; it does not replace role-owned artifacts.
Role-owned artifacts remain authoritative for their own content.

## Workflow Artifact Provenance

Cycle ownership must be recoverable from the artifact itself whenever STANDARDS
creates one of the records below. Create each with
`node .standards/bin/artifact.mjs init <TYPE>`, adding `--kind <ReviewKind>` for
a review; it writes the provenance block and record header and never overwrites
an existing file. Every newly created record begins with this block, using
exactly one concrete artifact type and the exact current cycle ID. A review
report adds `ReviewKind: IMPLEMENTATION | FINAL_DELIVERABLE` before `-->`, with
exactly one concrete kind matching its path and the current review state.

```markdown
<!-- STANDARDS
Artifact: SCOPE | ARCHITECTURE | DEVELOPMENT | VERIFICATION | REVIEW | DOCUMENTATION | SYNCHRONIZATION
Cycle: <Active Work.Id>
-->
```

| Record | Owner | Artifact type | Location | Entries |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Scoper | `SCOPE` | `.standards/docs/scope/<Active Work.Id>.md`, or an existing unmarked project document | `AC-NNN` list items (**Acceptance Traceability**) |

An existing unmarked project document remains project-owned when Scoper or
Architect selects it as the active scope or design location. The role may
update an appropriate unmarked canonical project document and must not add
STANDARDS provenance solely because `Active Work.Scope` or
`Active Work.Architecture` references it; a new scope or design record is
created with `artifact init` at its path in the table.

Every other record is always cycle-owned at its fixed path. Its provenance block
must match `Active Work.Id` and the path, and its visible `Cycle` field, plus
the visible `ReviewKind` field in a review report, must match the block.
`Active Work.Development` names the plan; the other fixed paths derive from the
cycle ID, so `STATE.md` gets no path field for them. Because every path in the
table includes the cycle ID, a new record's path never belongs to another cycle.

A valid provenance block makes the file a STANDARDS cycle-owned artifact even if
it is later renamed or moved. A different cycle may read it as prior evidence
when a role contract permits, but must never overwrite, repurpose, or adopt it.
Preserve other cycles' records and the other review kind's report, including
moved artifacts whose provenance still names their original cycle.

Before creating or editing a record, or an artifact referenced by
`Active Work.Scope`, `Active Work.Architecture`, or `Active Work.Development`,
inspect its path and any provenance block:

- A file that starts with a malformed STANDARDS block (for example an unknown
  artifact type, an invalid cycle ID, a missing or extra `ReviewKind`, or an
  unclosed block) is a collision for every artifact type. Do not edit, adopt, or
  repair it.
- An unrelated, unmarked, incorrectly marked, or different-cycle or
  different-kind file at a fixed path is a collision, and so is a non-directory
  or unsafe path that prevents the required location.
- An `Active Work` reference to another cycle's artifact is inconsistent with
  the active cycle. Do not overwrite or silently repair that artifact; correct
  the reference without mutating it.

Report a collision and block dependent work until the user resolves it,
preserving the existing content, without overwriting, relabeling, or adopting
it or silently choosing another path.

Test suites, fixtures, ordinary project documentation, comments, and docstrings
remain reusable project assets and do not acquire cycle provenance because a
role creates or updates them.

The development plan, review reports, documentation record, and synchronization
record number their entries as headings with the prefixes in the table. Get
each new number, and each new `AC-NNN`, with
`node .standards/bin/id.mjs next <prefix> <file>`. When a record refers to an
entry in another record, it names that record's path with the identifier, for
example `.standards/docs/reviews/<Active Work.Id>/implementation.md#F-003`; a
path relative to the referring file, as in a Markdown link, also works.
Acceptance identifiers (`AC-NNN`) and development steps (`DEV-NNN`) of the
active cycle are referred to without a path.

## Project context lifecycle

`.standards/CONTEXT.md` is the canonical Auditor-owned project-context artifact.
Installation does not fabricate it; Auditor creates or refreshes it when
`AUDITING` runs. In a `STANDARD` cycle, refreshed context is the project
baseline for downstream roles, subject to ownership and freshness rules. In an
`EXPEDITED` cycle, existing context is prior evidence only and is not presumed
refreshed.

Any **Active-Cycle Non-Baseline Work** entry is scoped to the `Active Work.Id`
that produced it and applies only while that same cycle is nonterminal; it is
stale in `SIGNED_OFF`, `CANCELLED`, and later cycles. A later audit reconciles
each prior-cycle exclusion against current repository and version-control
evidence, removing or reclassifying it rather than copying it forward, and
blocks for user clarification when baseline status cannot be established
safely.

Greenfield status does not require context to be absent. Before the first
scheduled greenfield audit, Scoping and Architecture may run or rerun without
`CONTEXT.md` when the facts their owned work needs are otherwise established;
absence of context alone is not a defect, and a role that needs project facts
that cannot safely be established without Auditor-owned context routes a
`PROJECT_CONTEXT` failure. Once
`CONTEXT.md` exists, later Scoping or Architecture work uses it when relevant,
even while `ProjectMode` remains `GREENFIELD`.

`.standards/MODE.md` and `.standards/STATE.md` are protocol-owned coordination
artifacts. A role or user may change them only through **Project Reset**, a
legal protocol transition, or a protocol-required coordination update,
including initializing `Active Work`, recording artifact paths, selecting or
promoting `CycleMode`, and setting or clearing `PromotionReason`,
`BaselineReconciliation`, `AuditTarget`, or `BlockedOn`.
`.standards/PROTOCOL.md` is framework-owned and may be changed only by framework
installation or upgrade.

## User Styles

A user style is a Markdown file of personal preferences for one role, kept at
`.standards/user-styles/<role>/<identifier>.md`, where `<role>` is the role's
skill name, such as `developer` or `tester`. Users add and maintain these files;
STANDARDS ships none. Installation and **Project Reset** keep them, and
**Project Uninstallation** deletes them with `.standards/`.

A role uses a user style only when the user explicitly selects one:

- The identifier is the filename stem: `tony` and `tony.md` both select
  `.standards/user-styles/<role>/tony.md`. Only a direct child Markdown file of
  that role's folder can be selected; reject paths, separators, traversal, and
  symlinks that leave the folder. `NONE` is reserved and means no user style.
- Never infer a style from the user's identity, repository ownership, prior
  usage, another role's selection, or the mere presence of a file.
- If a selection does not resolve to exactly one available file, stop and ask
  the user to choose an available style or clear the selection; never
  substitute another.

A user style governs discretionary choices only. Within a role's style
guidance, apply the role's `styles/universal.md` first when it has one, then the
selected user style, then the role's other applicable style files. A user style
never overrides the protocol, role ownership, the active contract, the required
shape of a role's artifacts, repository-enforced constraints, project
instructions, or correctness. A precedence list never settles a material
conflict; use **Instruction Layering and Conflicts**.

Roles that keep a cycle record persist the selection as `User Style` in that
record and reload it on resume: Developer's development plan, Tester's
verification report, Reviewer's review reports, Documenter's documentation
record, and Synchronizer's synchronization record. Scoper, Architect, Auditor,
and Navigator have no record for it, so their selection lasts only for the
current conversation and the user names it again when resuming. The user may
change or clear a selection at any time, except that Developer locks its
selection when the user first approves the development plan. If a persisted
selection's file is missing on resume, stop and ask the user to restore it or,
when the selection is not locked, to choose another or clear it.

## Installed Runtime Contract

The user installs, upgrades, resets, and uninstalls STANDARDS with the
`standards` CLI. The CLI's full contract is maintained in the STANDARDS
repository (`INSTALLER.md`) and is not installed. An installed project should
provide:

- `AGENTS.md`: project-facing entrypoint to the protocol and role skills;
- `CLAUDE.md`: Claude Code compatibility entrypoint importing `AGENTS.md`;
- `.standards/PROTOCOL.md`: installed canonical protocol;
- `.standards/VERSION.json`: installed framework version used to check upgrade
  eligibility;
- `.standards/INSTALLATION.json`: installer metadata, not workflow state,
  recording only the client settings, client paths, and hook files the
  installer created, so a reinstall or uninstall never claims or undoes the
  user's own settings;
- `.standards/MODE.md`: current `ProjectMode`;
- `.standards/STATE.md`: current workflow/cycle state and resumable coordination
  context;
- `.standards/bin/`: the runtime tools and hook script described in **Runtime
  Tools and Hooks**, replaced as a whole on every install and upgrade;
- `.standards/docs/`: the role-owned cycle records defined in **Workflow
  Artifact Provenance**, created only by the roles through `artifact init`;
- `.standards/user-styles/`: optional user-owned styles defined in **User
  Styles**;
- the S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. workflow skills installed in the location required by
  the selected coding agent;
- unless the user declines it, the STANDARDS stop hook in
  `.claude/settings.json` for Claude Code and in `.codex/hooks.json` for Codex;
- explicit-invocation controls: Codex adapters use
  `allow_implicit_invocation: false`; Claude Code project settings use
  `skillOverrides.<skill>: "user-invocable-only"` for installed role skills,
  including Navigator despite its position outside the workflow state machine.

`.standards/MODE.md` contains exactly one canonical `ProjectMode`; its
greenfield-to-brownfield transition follows **Project Modes**.
`.standards/STATE.md` contains exactly one canonical `WorkflowState` and
`CycleMode` and follows **Persisted Workflow State**.
A reinstall of the same version, or an upgrade to a newer minor or patch release
of the same major version, keeps workflow state, Auditor context, cycle records,
user styles, and project-owned instructions and settings, and replaces the
protocol, tools, skill files, and managed blocks. STANDARDS provides no
migration between major versions: moving an existing project to a new major
version means `standards uninstall`, which deletes `.standards/`, followed by a
fresh installation.

### Running the CLI

Agents run the `standards` CLI only when the user explicitly asks, except that
they run reset for **Greenfield Bootstrap Cancellation**, which adds its own
steps to these. `standards reset` and `standards uninstall` delete workflow
data, so for either command:

1. Pass `--project` with the project's absolute path and run the command with
   `--dry-run` first. Show the user the target, the planned changes, any
   warnings, and the exact command with `--yes`.
2. Run that command only after the user explicitly approves it. Outside a
   terminal the CLI does not ask for confirmation, so the approval must come
   from the user in the conversation.
3. If the preview changes before the command runs, show it again and get fresh
   approval. If the command refuses or fails, stop and report it with any
   backups it lists; do not delete or rewrite the files yourself.

### Project Reset

An explicit `standards reset` returns an installed project's workflow to the
state of a fresh installation without reinstalling anything, ending any active
cycle without a terminal state. Agents run it only as **Running the CLI**
allows.

- Default to the current directory; accept `--project <path>` and `--mode`.
  Offer `--dry-run` to report every planned change without writing files, and
  confirm interactively unless `--yes` is given.
- Require the runtime ownership marker and a valid `.standards/VERSION.json`
  that matches the CLI's version, because the fresh files come from the CLI's
  templates. Missing or invalid workflow files do not prevent a reset.
- Delete `.standards/CONTEXT.md` and `.standards/docs/`, warning with the count
  of cycle records, and write fresh `.standards/STATE.md` and
  `.standards/MODE.md`. Take the mode from `--mode`, otherwise choose it from
  the project's contents as a first installation would.
- Keep everything else: `PROTOCOL.md`, `VERSION.json`, `INSTALLATION.json`,
  `bin/`, `.standards/user-styles/`, the skills, hooks, client settings, and
  managed blocks.
- Refuse symlinks in the paths it deletes. Keep backups during the operation
  and restore them on an ordinary failure. If recovery fails, keep the backups
  and report their location. An interrupted operation blocks install, reset,
  and uninstall until the user resolves it.

### Project Uninstallation

An explicit `standards uninstall` removes all verified STANDARDS skill packages
for Codex and Claude Code, the managed blocks in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`,
the STANDARDS hooks, installer-added settings whose values are unchanged,
client files and folders the installer created once nothing else is in them,
and the entire
`.standards/` directory: saved workflow state, Auditor context, cycle records,
user styles, and any other content in it. It keeps project work outside those
paths, including reused scope or design documents, settings the user changed,
and a globally installed CLI. It is allowed in either project mode, with or
without an active cycle, and does not complete, sign off, cancel, or revert
project work. There is no force removal or client-only uninstall.

## Canonical Terms

Use these terms consistently across all skills, and likewise the names defined
in other sections, such as the handoff kinds (failure, forward, resume, and
promotion handoffs), expedited cycle, recovery frame, outstanding obligation,
active work, cycle mode, user style, runtime tools, and project reset:

- **completed scope**: scope artifact that passed Scoper's completion gate; it
  does not imply separate user approval unless the project adds such a gate.
- **scope-level acceptance conditions**: observable outcomes owned by Scoper,
  each identified by a stable `AC-NNN` **acceptance identifier** for the active
  cycle that downstream artifacts reuse.
- **retired acceptance identifier**: an ID whose condition was removed or
  materially replaced; retained so it cannot be reused and no longer a current
  coverage or verification obligation.
- **technical acceptance criteria**: Architect-derived technical conditions
  linked to scope-level acceptance identifiers.
- **development plan**: Developer's persisted plan for the active cycle. It
  decomposes the active contract into stable `DEV-NNN` steps, records
  collaboration mode and resumable progress, and never replaces scope,
  architecture, Tester verification, review, or documentation.
- **verification report**: records acceptance coverage, scenario allocations,
  actual execution evidence, gaps, and later-phase dependencies; it does not
  replace scope, design, or workflow coordination state.
- **review report**: records inspected inputs, checks, findings, limitations,
  dependencies, and resumable progress under **Review Gates**.
- **documentation record**: holds the evidence and progress that
  **Synchronization Gate** describes; it is distinct from reusable project
  documentation and does not replace another role's evidence or an acceptance
  authority.
- **synchronization record**: records assessed identities, references to
  completion and evidence artifacts, discrepancies and their owners,
  limitations, and a resumable conclusion under **Synchronization Gate**; it is
  not an acceptance ledger or user sign-off.
- **project context**: the Auditor-owned baseline in `.standards/CONTEXT.md`.
  It may persist as evidence across cycles under **Project context lifecycle**.
  A `PROJECT_CONTEXT` failure means it is materially incomplete, incorrect, or
  unexpectedly invalidated; planned implementation does not by itself make it
  stale.
- **completion gate**: conditions required before a role may make a forward
  handoff.
- **STANDARDS hook**: a Claude Code or Codex hook handler whose command runs
  `.standards/bin/hook.mjs`.

The paths of the records are in **Workflow Artifact Provenance**. Do not
introduce alternate names for these concepts inside individual skills unless
this protocol is updated first.
