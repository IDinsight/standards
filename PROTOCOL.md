# S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. Protocol

<!-- standards:framework-owned -->

This file is the canonical contract for shared workflow vocabulary, state,
transitions, recovery, and installation behavior in S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S.

`README.md` explains the framework at a high level. Individual skills define
role-specific behavior. This protocol defines the rules those skills must share.

## Roles

```text
Role
- SCOPER
- TESTER
- ARCHITECT
- NAVIGATOR
- DEVELOPER
- AUDITOR
- REVIEWER
- DOCUMENTER
- SYNCHRONIZER
```

A role owns decisions or artifacts; it is not necessarily a workflow state.
Workflow role skills are invoked explicitly by the user. `WorkflowState`
determines whether an invoked role may perform role-owned workflow work; it does
not dispatch a skill automatically. Where supported, client installation must
prevent implicit model invocation of workflow role skills.

`NAVIGATOR` is strictly non-mutating and outside the workflow state machine. It
may be invoked from any state and never changes `.standards/STATE.md`.

State ownership governs role-owned work, not protocol coordination. An explicit
user instruction may authorize a control-plane transition even when another role
or the user owns the current state. The receiving agent may make only the
coordination changes required by the applicable cycle-selection, `PROMOTE`,
`USER_REWORK`, `NEW_CYCLE`, `SIGNOFF`, or `CANCEL` rule. It must not perform the
target role's work unless that skill was also explicitly invoked and owns the
resulting state. An active workflow role may also `PROMOTE` without separate
user authorization when an expedited cycle can no longer safely remain
expedited.

## Project Modes

```text
ProjectMode
- GREENFIELD
- BROWNFIELD
```

- `GREENFIELD`: no meaningful pre-existing project implementation must be
  treated as established baseline.
- `BROWNFIELD`: meaningful implementation already exists and workflow work must
  understand, preserve, extend, repair, or otherwise depend on it.

Choose the initial mode from project state at installation. `GREENFIELD` is
temporary: during the initial greenfield cycle, Developer must permanently
change `.standards/MODE.md` to `BROWNFIELD` as soon as Developer observes and
verifies that the active cycle has successfully created or materially modified a
project implementation artifact. The trigger is implementation existence, not
authorship: it applies equally to code written by Developer and code applied by
the user during Developer collaboration. Workflow metadata and role-owned
planning, context, test, review, or documentation artifacts do not count as
project implementation. The mode never reverts, including during recovery.

For a `STANDARD` cycle:

- `GREENFIELD` starts in `SCOPING`.
- `BROWNFIELD` starts in `AUDITING`.

Before the first greenfield audit, missing Auditor-produced project context is
intentional. Treat it as a `PROJECT_CONTEXT` failure only when the active role
actually requires context that cannot be established from completed upstream
artifacts and known project constraints.

Cancellation while still `GREENFIELD` follows **Greenfield Bootstrap
Cancellation**. Cancellation after the permanent transition to `BROWNFIELD`
retains the runtime and enters terminal `CANCELLED`.

## Cycle Modes

```text
CycleMode
- UNSET
- STANDARD
- EXPEDITED
```

`ProjectMode` describes the persistent implementation baseline. `CycleMode`
records the assurance topology of the active cycle only. `PendingCycleMode`
records an explicit user preference for the next cycle before that cycle exists.
`PendingCycleRequest` and `PendingCycleBlockedOn` durably hold a next-cycle
request only when a pre-cycle decision prevents that request from becoming an
active cycle. All are persisted in `.standards/STATE.md`.

- `CycleMode: UNSET`: no cycle is active yet. It is a coordination value, not an
  execution topology.
- `CycleMode: STANDARD`: the active cycle uses the full topology for the current
  `ProjectMode`.
- `CycleMode: EXPEDITED`: the active cycle uses the bounded brownfield path that
  intentionally omits Scoping, Architecture, Auditing, Testing, Documentation,
  Final Review, and Synchronization unless promoted.
- `PendingCycleMode: UNSET`: no explicit next-cycle preference is persisted.
- `PendingCycleMode: STANDARD | EXPEDITED`: explicit user preference for the
  next cycle. It is not an active topology and must be validated when consumed.
- `PendingCycleRequest: UNSET | <request>`: normally `UNSET`; stores the actual
  next-cycle request only while a pre-cycle decision blocks cycle creation.
- `PendingCycleBlockedOn: NONE | <question>`: unresolved pre-cycle user decision
  for `PendingCycleRequest`, otherwise `NONE`. `PendingCycleRequest` and
  `PendingCycleBlockedOn` are paired: the request is `UNSET` exactly when the
  blocker is `NONE`.

Cycle-mode rules:

1. Installation initializes `CycleMode: UNSET`, `PendingCycleMode: UNSET`,
   `PendingCycleRequest: UNSET`, and `PendingCycleBlockedOn: NONE`. Terminal
   `SIGNED_OFF` and retained `CANCELLED` states reset `CycleMode` to `UNSET`
   after the completed or cancelled cycle's mode-specific transition rules have
   been applied; all pending-cycle fields must be clear at that point.
2. No role-owned workflow work may proceed with `CycleMode: UNSET`. Before the
   first substantive work of a cycle, consume and validate `PendingCycleMode`
   when it is not `UNSET`; otherwise select the mode from the new request and
   entry path. Persist the result in `CycleMode`, clear all pending-cycle fields
   to their neutral values, and initialize the required active work before
   role-owned work.
3. `GREENFIELD` supports only `STANDARD`. A pending `EXPEDITED` preference is
   invalid in `GREENFIELD` and must not be persisted.
4. `BROWNFIELD` supports both execution modes. If no pending preference exists
   for a new request, the standard topology is the default except that an
   explicit Developer invocation for a sufficiently bounded brownfield
   implementation change may select `EXPEDITED` as defined below.
5. While no cycle is active and before a request has initialized the next cycle,
   the user may set, replace, or clear `PendingCycleMode`. The latest explicit
   preference survives across sessions but does not modify `Active Work` or
   activate a cycle. If a blocked `PendingCycleRequest` already exists, changing
   or clearing the mode triggers revalidation of that persisted request.
6. A pending `EXPEDITED` preference does not bypass the expedited contract. When
   the request arrives, validate eligibility before consuming it. If the request
   is not eligible, do not silently reinterpret the preference as `STANDARD`;
   persist the request in `PendingCycleRequest`, persist the required user
   decision in `PendingCycleBlockedOn`, and require the user to choose
   `STANDARD`, revise the request, or abandon the pending request.
7. `EXPEDITED` remains valid only while the request is a sufficiently bounded
   implementation contract and no omitted role or guarantee is required.
8. Skipping a role does not transfer its ownership, artifacts, or completion
   guarantees to Developer or Reviewer.
9. Promotion to `STANDARD` follows **Expedited Promotion** and is one-way for
   the active cycle.

## Workflow States

```text
WorkflowState
- SCOPING
- ARCHITECTING
- AUDITING
- DEVELOPING
- TESTING
- REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION
- DOCUMENTING
- REVIEWING_FINAL
- SYNCHRONIZING
- AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF
- SIGNED_OFF
- CANCELLED
```

`.standards/STATE.md` records exactly one `WorkflowState`, one `CycleMode`, and
one set of pending-cycle coordination fields: `PendingCycleMode`,
`PendingCycleRequest`, and `PendingCycleBlockedOn`. `SIGNED_OFF` and `CANCELLED`
are terminal and mean there is no active cycle. In a terminal state, `CycleMode`
is `UNSET`; persisted `Active Work` data describe the most recent cycle for
traceability until `NEW_CYCLE` replaces them, while the pending-cycle fields may
independently describe an explicit next-cycle preference or a blocked next-cycle
request.

The owning role for each state is:

| Workflow state             | Owning role     |
|----------------------------|-----------------|
| `SCOPING`                  | `SCOPER`        |
| `ARCHITECTING`             | `ARCHITECT`     |
| `AUDITING`                 | `AUDITOR`       |
| `DEVELOPING`               | `DEVELOPER`     |
| `TESTING`                  | `TESTER`        |
| `REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION` | `REVIEWER`      |
| `DOCUMENTING`              | `DOCUMENTER`    |
| `REVIEWING_FINAL`          | `REVIEWER`      |
| `SYNCHRONIZING`            | `SYNCHRONIZER`  |
| `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`    | User            |
| `SIGNED_OFF`               | User (terminal) |
| `CANCELLED`                | User (terminal) |

## Persisted Workflow State

`.standards/STATE.md` is the authoritative, branch-persisted, version-controlled
record needed to resume workflow work across sessions or agents. Before workflow
work, read `.standards/PROTOCOL.md`, `.standards/MODE.md`, and
`.standards/STATE.md`. Resume
from persisted state, active work, handoff, recovery context, and outstanding
corrective obligations; do not infer a different state from chat history or
artifact presence.

`STATE.md` uses this shape:

```markdown
# S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. Workflow State

`WorkflowState`: `ARCHITECTING`
`CycleMode`: `STANDARD`
`PendingCycleMode`: `UNSET`
`PendingCycleRequest`: `UNSET`
`PendingCycleBlockedOn`: `NONE`

## Active Work

`Id`: `add-user-search-20260923T150000Z-a7f3` `Request`: `Add user search by name and email.` `Scope`:
`docs/scope/add-user-search.md` `Architecture`: `docs/specs/add-user-search.md`
`Development`: `docs/development/add-user-search-20260923T150000Z-a7f3.md` `PromotionReason`: `NONE`
`BaselineReconciliation`: `NONE` `AuditTarget`: `NONE` `BlockedOn`: `NONE`

## Handoff

`Kind`: `FAILURE` `From`: `TESTING` `FailureType`: `ARCHITECTURE` `Reason`:
`Retry behavior is not defined by the current technical design.`

## Recovery

`Active`: `true`

### Frame 1

`From`: `TESTING` `Owner`: `ARCHITECTING` `FailureType`: `ARCHITECTURE`
`Reason`: `Retry behavior is not defined by the current technical design.`
`ResumeAt`: `TESTING` `RerunThrough`: `NONE`

## Outstanding Obligations

`Active`: `false`
```

### Active Work

- `Id`: stable, user-readable identifier allocated through **Cycle ID
  Registry**. While the current S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. runtime remains installed,
  every allocated cycle ID is reserved permanently and must never be reused by
  another cycle. Generate every new ID with a request-derived slug plus a fresh
  collision-resistant token (for example a ULID, UUID fragment, or
  timestamp-plus-random suffix); never rely on a bare request slug. Never
  overwrite or repurpose an artifact belonging to another cycle.
- `Request`: persisted user request at enough fidelity for the entry role to
  understand the work.
- `Scope`, `Architecture`, and `Development`: repository-relative paths to the
  owning artifacts, or `NONE` until created. Scoper, Architect, and Developer
  must persist their artifact path before their normal completion gate passes.
  In expedited work `Scope` and `Architecture` normally remain `NONE` unless the
  cycle is promoted; `Development` is still Developer-owned and is created before
  implementation begins.
- `PromotionReason`: durable reason an expedited cycle was promoted, otherwise
  `NONE`. Preserve it for the remainder of the cycle; it is workflow context,
  not a user requirement, scope decision, architecture decision, or baseline
  fact.
- `BaselineReconciliation`: durable provenance for unresolved project changes
  retained from cancelled cycles, otherwise `NONE`. It must be resolved before
  the current cycle may rely on the affected repository state as established
  baseline. Preserve each source cycle distinctly by unique `Id` plus brief
  request summary. Carry it across handoffs, failures, rework, recovery, and
  cancellation until Auditor resolves the baseline and clears it.
  `Handoff.Reason` is not a substitute.
- `AuditTarget`: transient repository-relative path or area label for an
  in-progress targeted audit when that focus cannot otherwise be recovered from
  persisted active work, owned artifacts, or recovery context; otherwise
  `NONE`. Auditor must persist an ad-hoc user-directed target before relying on
  it and clear it when that targeted audit completes, is abandoned, or no longer
  needs separate persistence.
- `BlockedOn`: unresolved user question preventing completion, otherwise
  `NONE`.

Installation initializes `Id` and `Request` as `UNSET`. Before the first
workflow role performs substantive work, select and validate `CycleMode`
according to **Cycle Modes**, consuming `PendingCycleMode` when present; then
allocate the cycle ID through **Cycle ID Registry**. Only after the registry
append succeeds may the reserved ID, request, and selected mode be persisted as
the initialized cycle. Every later `NEW_CYCLE` follows the same allocation rule
as part of the transition.

### Cycle ID Registry

`.standards/CYCLE_IDS.md` is the protocol-owned, append-only registry of every
cycle ID allocated while the current S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. runtime remains
installed. It exists only to reserve cycle identifiers; it is not workflow
history and must not duplicate requests, states, handoffs, or artifact metadata.
Store one allocated ID per Markdown list entry:

```markdown
# S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. Cycle ID Registry

- <cycle-id>
```

Allocate a new cycle ID in this order:

1. Generate a request-derived, collision-resistant candidate.
2. Verify that the candidate does not already appear in `CYCLE_IDS.md`.
3. As defense in depth, also verify that it does not collide with an existing
   cycle-owned artifact path or STANDARDS provenance marker, including
   `docs/development/<candidate>.md`.
4. Append the candidate to `CYCLE_IDS.md` and persist that registry change.
5. Only after the registry append succeeds may the candidate be written to
   `Active Work.Id` and cycle initialization continue.

Registry entries are immutable while the runtime remains installed: never edit,
remove, reorder for deduplication, or reuse an existing entry. If cycle
initialization fails after the append, leave the ID reserved; a burned ID is
safe, while reuse is not. The registry is the authoritative no-reuse record;
artifact-path and provenance checks are additional collision protection, not a
replacement for the registry.

Initialize `CYCLE_IDS.md` empty on first installation. Preserve it across normal
reinstall, framework upgrade, and explicit workflow reinitialization. For an
upgrade from a protocol version that did not require the registry,
verify that fact from the currently installed pre-update protocol, then create
and seed `CYCLE_IDS.md` before replacing that installed protocol or allocating
any further cycle ID. Seed every cycle ID that can be discovered from current
persisted state and existing STANDARDS cycle-owned artifacts/provenance. IDs
that cannot be reconstructed from a pre-registry runtime cannot be retroactively
guaranteed; the registry-backed no-reuse guarantee applies to every ID allocated
after registry initialization.

If `CYCLE_IDS.md` is unexpectedly missing from an installed runtime whose
installed protocol already requires the registry, treat the runtime as
incomplete: stop cycle allocation and workflow work that would require a new
cycle ID, report the missing registry, and require restoration of the registry
or intentional runtime removal followed by a fresh installation. Never recreate
an empty registry or best-effort reconstruct one in place for a registry-aware
runtime, because doing so would silently break the installed-runtime no-reuse
guarantee. The only automatic creation-and-seeding exception is the verified
upgrade path from a pre-registry protocol described above.

Intentional removal of the S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. runtime may remove the registry
with `.standards/`; that removal ends the registry-backed lifetime guarantee. A
later fresh installation starts a new registry, while existing artifact and
provenance collision checks still apply.

### Workflow Artifact Provenance

Cycle ownership must be recoverable from the artifact itself whenever STANDARDS
creates a Scope, Architecture, or Development artifact. Every such newly created
artifact must begin with this provenance block, using exactly one concrete
artifact type and the exact current cycle ID:

```markdown
<!-- STANDARDS
Artifact: SCOPE | ARCHITECTURE | DEVELOPMENT
Cycle: <Active Work.Id>
-->
```

A valid provenance block makes the file a STANDARDS cycle-owned artifact even if
it is later renamed or moved. A different cycle may read that artifact as prior
evidence when a role contract permits, but it must never overwrite, repurpose,
or adopt the file as its own cycle artifact.

An existing unmarked project document remains project-owned merely because
Scoper or Architect selects it as the active scope or architecture location.
Those roles may update an appropriate unmarked canonical project document, and
must not add STANDARDS provenance solely because the document is referenced by
`Active Work.Scope` or `Active Work.Architecture`. If either role instead creates
a new workflow artifact, it must add the current-cycle provenance block. If the
natural target path already contains a STANDARDS artifact owned by another
cycle, choose a distinct path rather than overwriting it.

Developer's development plan is always a STANDARDS cycle-owned artifact. Its
path must be unique to the active cycle and include `Active Work.Id`; use
`docs/development/<Active Work.Id>.md` unless the repository requires another
development-plan directory, in which case preserve the same cycle-specific
filename. Its provenance block and the plan's visible `Cycle` field must both
match `Active Work.Id`.

Before editing an artifact referenced by `Active Work.Scope`,
`Active Work.Architecture`, or `Active Work.Development`, the owning role must
inspect any STANDARDS provenance block. If the block records a different cycle,
do not overwrite or silently repair the artifact; the persisted reference is
inconsistent with the active cycle and must be corrected without mutating the
other cycle's artifact.

### Handoff

`Handoff.Kind` is one of `INITIAL`, `FORWARD`, `FAILURE`, `RESUME`, `PROMOTE`,
`USER_REWORK`, `NEW_CYCLE`, `SIGNOFF`, or `CANCEL`. Use `NONE` for inapplicable
fields. `Reason` describes only the latest transition and must remain concise;
it is not durable storage for outstanding recovery or baseline obligations.

Use `RESUME` whenever a recovery frame returns to `ResumeAt`, and for any other
recovery-directed transition that is not the normal forward handoff.

### Recovery

`Recovery` is a stack ordered oldest to newest; the last frame is active. A
frame preserves one corrective defect together with the routing needed to return
to interrupted work. A role owns the active frame only when the current
`WorkflowState` equals its `Owner`.

`RerunThrough` is `NONE` until the frame owner resolves the defect. If previously
completed downstream work must be re-established before `ResumeAt`, the owner
sets it to the last state in that rerun sequence. Merely running during recovery
does not make a role responsible for the frame.

### Outstanding Obligations

`Outstanding Obligations` preserves unresolved corrective work when the recovery
routing that carried it is no longer valid. It is ordered oldest to newest. Each
obligation records `Owner`, `FailureType`, and `Reason`; it deliberately has no
`From`, `ResumeAt`, or `RerunThrough`.

Normally the recovery frame itself is the durable corrective obligation and no
duplicate outstanding obligation is created. `RerunThrough: NONE` means the
frame's owner has not yet completed its correction; a non-`NONE` `RerunThrough`
means the owner already passed its corrective gate and the frame remains only to
finish downstream rerun/resume routing. During **Expedited Promotion**, convert
each recovery frame whose `RerunThrough` is `NONE` into one outstanding obligation
before clearing the expedited recovery stack. Do not convert frames whose
`RerunThrough` is non-`NONE`. Preserve converted obligations in recovery-stack
order, keep each distinct defect separate, and do not collapse defects merely
because they share an owner or failure type.

When one or more obligations exist, set `Active: true` and record each as a
numbered `Obligation N` containing `Owner`, `FailureType`, and `Reason`. When the
last obligation is removed, set `Active: false` and remove the numbered entries.

An outstanding obligation remains until its owning state is reached and the
owner corrects and verifies the specific defect recorded by the obligation.
Remove a corrected obligation as soon as that corrective outcome is verified;
removing it records only that the obligation itself is satisfied and does not
imply that the owning role is otherwise complete. The owner must still pass its
normal completion gate, including the requirement that no unresolved obligation
owned by its current state remains, before any normal forward handoff. User
sign-off is unavailable while any outstanding obligation remains.

### State-update rules

1. Installation initializes from the selected mode template: `SCOPING` for
   `GREENFIELD`, `AUDITING` for `BROWNFIELD`, `CycleMode: UNSET`,
   `PendingCycleMode: UNSET`, `PendingCycleRequest: UNSET`,
   `PendingCycleBlockedOn: NONE`, `Handoff.Kind: INITIAL`, unset active work,
   and inactive recovery.
2. Before substantive work on an initialized cycle, select and persist the cycle
   mode and initialize active work according to **Cycle Modes**, **Active Work**,
   and **User Decisions and Intervention**.
3. Every legal state-changing transition updates all applicable `CycleMode`,
   pending-cycle coordination fields, `Active Work`, `Handoff`, `Recovery`, and
   `Outstanding Obligations` fields as part of the transition.
4. Blocking questions during an active cycle do not change workflow state. Set
   `Active Work.BlockedOn` before asking and clear it after incorporating the
   answer. Pre-cycle control-plane questions must not modify
   `Active Work.BlockedOn`; persist the blocked request and question in
   `PendingCycleRequest` and `PendingCycleBlockedOn` instead.
5. Failure/recovery, promotion, and user-control transitions follow their
   canonical sections below rather than redefining their mechanics here.
6. During the initial greenfield cycle, Developer performs the permanent
   `GREENFIELD` -> `BROWNFIELD` mode change as soon as Developer observes and
   verifies that the active cycle has successfully created or materially modified
   a project implementation artifact, regardless of whether Developer or the user
   authored the change during Developer collaboration.

`STATE.md` coordinates the workflow; it does not replace role-owned artifacts.
Role-owned artifacts remain authoritative for their own content.

### Project context lifecycle

`.standards/CONTEXT.md` is the canonical Auditor-owned project-context artifact.
Installation does not fabricate it. Auditor creates or refreshes it when
`AUDITING` runs.

For a `STANDARD` cycle, refreshed context is the project baseline for downstream
roles, subject to ownership and freshness rules. In an `EXPEDITED` cycle,
existing context is prior evidence only; it is not presumed refreshed.

Any **Active-Cycle Non-Baseline Work** entry is scoped to the `Active Work.Id`
that produced it and applies only while that same cycle is nonterminal. It is
stale in `SIGNED_OFF`, `CANCELLED`, and later cycles. A later audit must
reconcile each prior-cycle exclusion against current repository and
version-control evidence, removing or reclassifying it rather than copying it
forward. If baseline status cannot be established safely, Auditor blocks for
user clarification.

Greenfield status does not require context to be absent. Before the first
scheduled greenfield audit, Scoping and Architecture may run or rerun without
`CONTEXT.md` when the facts required for their owned work are otherwise
established; absence of context by itself is not a defect. If either role needs
project facts that cannot safely be established without Auditor-owned context,
it routes a `PROJECT_CONTEXT` failure to Auditor. Once `CONTEXT.md` exists,
later Scoping or Architecture work must use it when relevant and must not ignore
it merely because `ProjectMode` remains `GREENFIELD`. After Developer observes
and verifies the first successful creation or material modification of a project
implementation artifact as part of the active cycle, `ProjectMode` remains
`BROWNFIELD` permanently, regardless of who authored that implementation
change.

`.standards/MODE.md` and `.standards/STATE.md` are protocol-owned coordination
artifacts. A role or user may change them only as required by a legal protocol
transition or a protocol-required coordination update defined here, including
initializing `Active Work`, recording artifact paths, selecting or promoting
`CycleMode`, and setting or clearing `PromotionReason`,
`BaselineReconciliation`, `AuditTarget`, or `BlockedOn`.
`.standards/PROTOCOL.md` is framework-owned and may be changed only by framework
installation or upgrade.

## Instruction Layering and Conflicts

Role-specific precedence may order **compatible** guidance, such as applying a
repository formatter before generic style preferences. Precedence must never be
used to silently resolve a material conflict among the protocol or installed
integration contract, explicit user constraints, completed role-owned workflow
artifacts, project-specific instructions, or repository-enforced/toolchain
constraints.

When authorities materially conflict:

1. If the conflict is a defect or changed requirement owned by a workflow role,
   route it through the protocol's normal failure, recovery, or `USER_REWORK`
   mechanics to that owner.
2. If no workflow owner can resolve the contradiction without overriding another
   authority, or project instructions conflict with the protocol/integration
   contract, stop workflow work and require user resolution.
3. Do not weaken an authority, invent an exception, or choose a winner merely
   because one source appears earlier in a role-specific precedence list.

Role skills should reference these rules rather than redefine conflict-resolution
semantics locally.

## Acceptance Traceability

These obligations apply only to `STANDARD` cycles and do not create a shared
traceability artifact or add acceptance data to `STATE.md`. `EXPEDITED` cycles
do not fabricate Scoper-owned acceptance conditions or substitute identifiers.
If an expedited cycle is promoted, Scoper establishes them when the standard
topology reaches `SCOPING`.

1. Scoper represents every verifiable in-scope completion obligation as one or
   more acceptance conditions with stable, unique `AC-NNN` identifiers for the
   active cycle. Do not combine separable obligations under one identifier when
   their satisfaction or verification evidence is established in different
   workflow phases. The identifier is a reference, not an ordering guarantee.
2. During REPLAN, preserve an identifier when meaning is unchanged. New or
   materially replaced conditions receive previously unused identifiers.
   Removed or replaced identifiers remain in the scope's retired-identifier
   record. Never renumber surviving identifiers or reuse retired ones within
   the cycle.
3. Scoper owns acceptance wording and meaning. Downstream roles reference IDs
   but do not redefine intent; material defects route to Scoper.
4. Architect accounts for every current ID with technical design coverage or an
   explicit no-architectural-impact disposition when satisfaction depends
   entirely on established nontechnical behavior or work owned by another
   workflow phase. Group IDs only when the same disposition applies; do not
   invent architecture or claim ownership of satisfaction that belongs to
   another workflow phase.
5. All downstream coverage, work, and evidence references the same current IDs;
   downstream roles do not invent substitute requirement IDs.
6. Tester accounts for every current ID with verification evidence, a blocker,
   or—when satisfaction explicitly depends on a later role—a pending dependency.
   Pending is not verification evidence and must be resolved downstream under
   the same ID.
7. `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF` is forbidden while any current ID lacks sufficient
   evidence or has an unresolved blocker. Route defects to their owning roles
   through normal failure and recovery rules; never treat an unevidenced
   condition as satisfied by assumption.
8. Acceptance changes during recovery or rework invalidate any completed
   downstream artifact whose completion contract requires accounting for every
   current ID. Include those states when computing downstream invalidation even
   if underlying behavior or technical decisions remain otherwise valid.

## Expedited Cycle Contract

An `EXPEDITED` cycle provides a deliberately narrower completion contract:

1. It is valid only in `BROWNFIELD`.
2. `Active Work.Request` is the change contract. `Scope` and `Architecture`
   remain `NONE` unless promotion later causes their owners to create them.
3. Existing project context may be consulted as prior evidence but is not
   refreshed by default. Prior-cycle non-baseline entries are stale for the
   current cycle. If safe completion depends on baseline status that requires
   Auditor-owned context, promote instead of assigning that work to Developer.
4. Active-cycle implementation remains tentative. Promotion does not make it
   established baseline. Auditor must distinguish pre-cycle baseline from
   active-cycle changes using authoritative evidence and block rather than guess
   when materially ambiguous.
5. Developer owns implementation and normal implementation-level self-checks;
   these are not Tester-owned formal verification.
6. Reviewer still owns `REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION` and may route implementation
   defects through normal recovery.
7. Scoper, Architect, Auditor, Tester, Documenter, `REVIEWING_FINAL`, and
   Synchronizer are absent from the expedited forward topology. Their missing
   artifacts or gates are not failures.
8. The cycle may reach `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF` after Developer and implementation
   Reviewer pass their gates, recovery is empty, and no blocking user question
   remains. Scope-level acceptance traceability does not apply.
9. If safe completion requires an omitted role or guarantee, use **Expedited
   Promotion** instead of weakening ownership or fabricating skipped work.

## Review Kinds

```text
ReviewKind
- IMPLEMENTATION
- FINAL_DELIVERABLE
```

`IMPLEMENTATION` corresponds to `REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION`.
`FINAL_DELIVERABLE` corresponds to `REVIEWING_FINAL`. A review handoff must
identify the requested kind.

## Failure Types

```text
FailureType
- SCOPING
- ARCHITECTURE
- PROJECT_CONTEXT
- IMPLEMENTATION
- VERIFICATION
- DOCUMENTATION
- REVIEW
- SYNCHRONIZATION
```

| Failure type      | Owning role    |
|-------------------|----------------|
| `SCOPING`         | `SCOPER`       |
| `ARCHITECTURE`    | `ARCHITECT`    |
| `PROJECT_CONTEXT` | `AUDITOR`      |
| `IMPLEMENTATION`  | `DEVELOPER`    |
| `VERIFICATION`    | `TESTER`       |
| `DOCUMENTATION`   | `DOCUMENTER`   |
| `REVIEW`          | `REVIEWER`     |
| `SYNCHRONIZATION` | `SYNCHRONIZER` |

The discoverer of a failure does not automatically own the fix. Route it to the
owner of the defective artifact or decision.

## Forward Transitions

A forward transition occurs only after the current state's completion gate
passes.

### Standard Greenfield

```text
SCOPING
-> ARCHITECTING
-> AUDITING
-> DEVELOPING
-> TESTING
-> REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION
-> DOCUMENTING
-> REVIEWING_FINAL
-> SYNCHRONIZING
-> AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF
```

### Standard Brownfield

```text
AUDITING
-> SCOPING
-> ARCHITECTING
-> DEVELOPING
-> TESTING
-> REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION
-> DOCUMENTING
-> REVIEWING_FINAL
-> SYNCHRONIZING

```

For brownfield standard work, `ARCHITECTING -> DEVELOPING` requires valid
project context for the active cycle. Missing, materially incomplete, incorrect,
or unexpectedly invalidated context routes to `AUDITING`. Planned active-cycle
implementation changes do not alone make context stale.

### Expedited Brownfield

```text
DEVELOPING
-> REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION
-> AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF
```

This topology is valid only for `ProjectMode: BROWNFIELD` and
`CycleMode: EXPEDITED`. Skipped standard work must not be synthesized inside
Developer or Reviewer.

## Expedited Promotion

Promotion changes a nonterminal `EXPEDITED` brownfield cycle to `STANDARD` when
the bounded contract is no longer sufficient. It is a topology change, not a
failure handoff.

Promote when safe completion requires formal Scoping, consequential
Architecture, authoritative Auditor-owned context, Tester-owned verification,
Documentation, Final Review, Synchronization, or another intentionally omitted
guarantee.

1. Promotion is valid only from a nonterminal expedited brownfield cycle.
2. An active workflow role may promote when required. At
   `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, user authorization is required. An explicit promote
   request qualifies; so does an explicit rework request whose changed contract
   necessarily requires an omitted standard role or guarantee.
3. Set `CycleMode: STANDARD`, `WorkflowState: AUDITING`, and
   `Handoff.Kind: PROMOTE`; set `From` to the interrupted state,
   `FailureType: NONE`, and record a concise reason identifying which omitted
   standard guarantee is now required. Persist the same reason in
   `Active Work.PromotionReason`.
4. Preserve cycle `Id`, `Request`, and role-owned artifacts. Do not fabricate
   `Scope` or `Architecture`. Existing expedited implementation remains
   tentative active-cycle work, not baseline.
5. Auditor establishes or refreshes context without laundering tentative work
   into pre-existing baseline. Material ambiguity requires a user question.
6. Before clearing recovery, convert every expedited recovery frame with
   `RerunThrough: NONE` into an `Outstanding Obligations` entry preserving its
   `Owner`, `FailureType`, and `Reason`, in recovery-stack order. Those frames
   still represent unresolved owner corrections. Do not convert frames with a
   non-`NONE` `RerunThrough`; their owner already passed its corrective gate and
   they remain only for obsolete expedited rerun/resume routing. Do not carry
   `From`, `ResumeAt`, or `RerunThrough` into an obligation. Then clear recovery.
   The standard brownfield topology restarts at `AUDITING`.
7. Promotion is one-way for the active cycle.
8. All standard forward, failure, recovery, outstanding-obligation, traceability,
   and sign-off rules apply afterward.

## Failure Handoffs

A failure handoff routes a defect to its owning state:

```text
SCOPING failure         -> SCOPING
ARCHITECTURE failure    -> ARCHITECTING
PROJECT_CONTEXT failure -> AUDITING
IMPLEMENTATION failure  -> DEVELOPING
VERIFICATION failure    -> TESTING
DOCUMENTATION failure   -> DOCUMENTING
REVIEW failure          -> REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION or REVIEWING_FINAL, matching the affected review
SYNCHRONIZATION failure -> SYNCHRONIZING
```

In `STANDARD`, use this routing directly. In `EXPEDITED`, only
`IMPLEMENTATION -> DEVELOPING` and implementation `REVIEW ->
REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION` are valid failure routes because only those states
exist in the expedited topology. A defect or guarantee owned by a skipped role
requires **Expedited Promotion**, not a failure transition into a skipped state.

If routing changes state, apply **Recovery Mechanics**. A same-state failure
records the handoff but does not create a recovery frame.

## Recovery Mechanics

This is the canonical recovery algorithm. Skills define only how their role
corrects its owned work, evaluates its completion gate, and identifies which
previously completed downstream states its correction invalidates.

Recovery follows the active `CycleMode` topology. Expedited recovery reruns only
expedited states; a newly required skipped role or guarantee triggers
**Expedited Promotion**, which preserves unresolved corrective obligations as
`Outstanding Obligations` and clears only the now-obsolete expedited recovery
routing.

1. **Push only when corrective routing changes state.** For `FAILURE` or
   `USER_REWORK` moving to a different state, push a frame with `From` =
   interrupted state, `Owner` = corrective target, applicable `FailureType` and
   `Reason`, `ResumeAt` = interrupted state, and `RerunThrough: NONE`.
   Same-state correction creates no frame.
2. **Preserve nesting.** New failure or rework during recovery pushes another
   frame. Never overwrite older frames. The last frame is active.
3. **Only the active frame owner plans resumption.** After correcting the defect
   and passing its normal gate, that owner decides whether previously completed
   downstream states must be re-established before `ResumeAt`.
4. **No rerun:** pop the frame and transition directly to `ResumeAt` with
   `Handoff.Kind: RESUME`.
5. **Rerun required:** set `RerunThrough` to the last required state and
   transition to the earliest required rerun state. Keep the frame on the
   stack.
6. **Rerun states use normal gates and legal forward handoffs** while preserving
   the stack. They do not own the frame unless a nested defect creates a new one.
7. **At the rerun boundary**, after `RerunThrough` passes its gate, pop the frame
   and transition to `ResumeAt` with `Handoff.Kind: RESUME` instead of taking
   the normal forward handoff. This explicit return is valid even when
   `ResumeAt` lies outside the project's normal forward topology.
8. Recovery ends only when the stack is empty.

Examples:

```text
Architecture defect discovered during testing:
TESTING -> ARCHITECTING                 # push frame, ResumeAt TESTING
ARCHITECTING -> DEVELOPING              # set RerunThrough DEVELOPING
DEVELOPING -> TESTING                   # boundary completes, pop, resume TESTING

Scoping defect discovered during implementation review:
REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION -> SCOPING     # push frame
SCOPING -> ARCHITECTING                 # set RerunThrough TESTING
ARCHITECTING -> DEVELOPING -> TESTING
TESTING -> REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION     # pop, explicit resume

Invalid project context discovered during architecture:
ARCHITECTING -> AUDITING                # push frame
AUDITING -> ARCHITECTING                # no rerun; pop and resume

Nested recovery:
TESTING -> AUDITING                     # outer frame, ResumeAt TESTING
AUDITING -> SCOPING                     # nested rework frame, ResumeAt AUDITING
SCOPING -> ARCHITECTING                 # set nested RerunThrough DEVELOPING
ARCHITECTING -> DEVELOPING
DEVELOPING -> AUDITING                  # pop nested frame, explicit resume
```

## Commit Message Guidance

After role work, if the role produced a meaningful atomic set of repository
changes, provide a suggested Git commit message. Do not create the commit unless
the user explicitly requests it. Coordination-only changes such as advancing
`STATE.md` do not justify a suggestion by themselves.

Use Conventional Commits:

```text
<type>(<optional-scope>): <description>
```

Choose type and scope from the actual changes, not the role or workflow state.
Common types include `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `build`,
`ci`, and `chore`. Keep the description concise, imperative, and specific. Use
breaking-change syntax or footers only for genuinely breaking changes.

Examples:

```text
docs(scope): define user search requirements
docs(architecture): define user search contracts
chore(context): capture authentication project baseline
feat(search): implement user search
test(search): cover user search behavior
docs(search): document user search
fix(search): address implementation review findings
```

`NAVIGATOR` never suggests a commit. Other roles omit the suggestion when they
produced no meaningful committable changes. When both a commit suggestion and a
next-role invocation are emitted, present the commit suggestion first.

## Handoff Rules

1. Forward handoff requires the current completion gate to pass.
2. A role does not repair work it does not own; failures route under **Failure
   Handoffs**.
3. A handoff identifies its target role or workflow state. A failure handoff
   also identifies `FailureType`; `REVIEW` targets the Reviewer state matching
   the affected `ReviewKind`.
4. No role silently changes another role's artifact or decision.
5. Corrective routing and reruns follow **Recovery Mechanics**; skills must not
   redefine that algorithm.
6. User sign-off, rework, cancellation, and new-cycle transitions follow **User
   Decisions and Intervention**.
7. Promotion follows **Expedited Promotion** and is not encoded as `FAILURE`.
8. Every state-changing handoff persists the applicable state, active-work,
   handoff, recovery, and outstanding-obligation changes before further role
   work. Persist the state
   change before presenting any next-role invocation.
9. After a legal transition to a different workflow role, provide a concise
   copy/paste invocation for that role unless the same user instruction already
   explicitly invoked it and it will continue immediately. Do not emit one when
   the workflow remains with the same role, a blocking question is unresolved,
   the result is `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, `SIGNED_OFF`, or `CANCELLED`, or
   Navigator is used.
10. The invocation is convenience only; `STATE.md` and role-owned artifacts
    remain authoritative. Use the active client's syntax and avoid duplicating
    authoritative workflow content unless needed for disambiguation:

```text
Next role: <Role>

Codex:       $<skill> Continue the active workflow from `.standards/STATE.md`. Read the persisted Active Work, relevant project context and owned artifacts, and recovery context before proceeding.
Claude Code: /<skill> Continue the active workflow from `.standards/STATE.md`. Read the persisted Active Work, relevant project context and owned artifacts, and recovery context before proceeding.
```

Emit only the active-client line. When recovery is active, replace “active
workflow” with “active recovery” and explicitly direct the role to read the
active recovery frame.

At `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, present the applicable user actions rather than a
next-role invocation.

## User Decisions and Intervention

These are user-authorized control-plane transitions. An explicit, unambiguous
user instruction may authorize the receiving agent to persist the coordination
change regardless of current state ownership. That exception authorizes only
the protocol transition itself. Resulting role-owned work may proceed only when
that role was explicitly invoked and owns the resulting state; otherwise stop
after persisting the transition and provide the next-role invocation when the
handoff rules require one.

### Select a pending mode before a cycle begins

While no cycle is active, or before the initialized first cycle has received its
request, an explicit user instruction may set `PendingCycleMode` to a mode
supported by the current `ProjectMode`, replace an earlier pending preference,
or clear it to `UNSET`. Leave `CycleMode: UNSET` and leave `Active Work.Id` and
`Active Work.Request` unchanged. The latest pending selection remains
authoritative across sessions until consumed, replaced, or cleared.

When the first real request arrives, determine the legal mode before creating
the cycle. If the same instruction explicitly requests a mode that the current
`ProjectMode` does not support, do not persist that mode; persist the request and
required decision in the pending request/blocker fields and ask for a supported
mode, revision, or abandonment. If `PendingCycleMode` is already set, validate
it against the request and current `ProjectMode`. If it is invalid, leave `CycleMode`,
`Active Work`, and `PendingCycleMode` unchanged; persist the request in
`PendingCycleRequest`, set `PendingCycleBlockedOn` to the specific decision required,
and ask the user to replace or clear the preference, revise the request, or abandon the
pending request. Do not write `Active Work.BlockedOn`.

While `PendingCycleRequest` is not `UNSET`, a later mode replacement/clear or a
revised request must revalidate the persisted pending request before asking the
user to repeat it. A revised request replaces `PendingCycleRequest`. If the
pending request becomes legal from `SIGNED_OFF` or retained `CANCELLED`, do not
initialize `Active Work` through this generic path; continue through **Start a
new cycle** using `PendingCycleRequest` as the new request so terminal handoff
and baseline-reconciliation requirements are preserved. Otherwise, for the
initialized first cycle, allocate the ID through **Cycle ID Registry** first;
after that registry append succeeds, persist the reserved `Active Work.Id`, that
request, and the validated/defaulted mode in the cycle-state update; clear
`PendingCycleMode` to `UNSET`, `PendingCycleRequest` to `UNSET`, and
`PendingCycleBlockedOn` to `NONE`; then enter the legal workflow state. If the
user abandons the blocked pre-cycle request, clear `PendingCycleRequest` and
`PendingCycleBlockedOn` without modifying `Active Work` or starting a cycle.

If no pending preference exists for a new request, invoking the standard entry
role selects `STANDARD` by default. Use the standard entry state for the current
`ProjectMode`: `SCOPING` for `GREENFIELD` and `AUDITING` for `BROWNFIELD`.

### Select expedited mode for the initialized cycle

Before substantive work, while `Active Work.Id` and `Active Work.Request` are
both `UNSET` and `CycleMode` is `UNSET`, a brownfield request may start an
`EXPEDITED` cycle when either `PendingCycleMode: EXPEDITED` is valid for the
request or Developer is explicitly invoked with a new sufficiently bounded
implementation request while `PendingCycleMode: UNSET`. A pending
`STANDARD` preference prevents Developer from inferring `EXPEDITED`.

After expedited eligibility is validated, allocate the new ID through **Cycle
ID Registry** before assigning it to `Active Work`. Then set `CycleMode:
EXPEDITED`; clear `PendingCycleMode` to `UNSET`, `PendingCycleRequest` to `UNSET`,
and `PendingCycleBlockedOn` to `NONE`; set `WorkflowState: DEVELOPING`;
initialize `Active Work` with the reserved ID/request plus `Scope: NONE`,
`Architecture: NONE`, `Development: NONE`, `PromotionReason: NONE`, and
`BaselineReconciliation: NONE`; keep `Handoff.Kind: INITIAL`, set `From: NONE`
and `FailureType: NONE`, record a concise expedited-entry reason, and keep
recovery and outstanding obligations inactive. This is unavailable in
`GREENFIELD`.

### Promote an expedited cycle

An explicit user instruction may authorize **Expedited Promotion** from any
nonterminal expedited brownfield state, including `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`.
After persisting promotion, stop and hand off to Auditor unless Auditor was also
explicitly invoked. Active workflow roles may promote without separate user
instruction when the expedited contract becomes insufficient.

### Rework an active cycle

From any nonterminal state, update `Active Work.Request` when the request
changed, identify the earliest owned artifact or decision invalidated, record
`Handoff.Kind: USER_REWORK` with its `FailureType`, and route to that owner. If
state changes, push the recovery frame defined by **Recovery Mechanics** with
`ResumeAt` equal to the interrupted state; preserve older frames. User-requested
changes are not agent-discovered failures.

In `EXPEDITED`, bounded implementation rework routes to `DEVELOPING`. If the new
contract requires a skipped standard role or guarantee, the rework request
itself authorizes **Expedited Promotion** instead.

### Cancel an active cycle

- If `ProjectMode: GREENFIELD`, follow **Greenfield Bootstrap Cancellation**.
- If `ProjectMode: BROWNFIELD`, transition to `CANCELLED`, set
  `CycleMode: UNSET`, leave all pending-cycle fields clear, record
  `Handoff.Kind: CANCEL`, set `From` to the
  interrupted state, `FailureType: NONE`, preserve `Active Work`, and clear
  recovery plus outstanding obligations. Residual project-change provenance is
  handled through `BaselineReconciliation` when a later cycle starts.

Cancellation never reverts project artifacts and does not by itself establish
cancelled-cycle project changes as baseline.

### Sign off

From `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, sign-off is legal only when the `Outstanding Obligations`
section is inactive. Validate the completion contract using the current
`STANDARD` or `EXPEDITED` mode, then transition to `SIGNED_OFF`, set
`CycleMode: UNSET`, leave all pending-cycle fields clear, record
`Handoff.Kind: SIGNOFF`,
`From: AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, `FailureType: NONE`, and clear recovery. The
cycle is complete.

For `STANDARD`, all standard gates and acceptance-traceability obligations must
be satisfied before the reset. For `EXPEDITED`, sign-off covers only the
narrower **Expedited Cycle Contract**; skipped standard phases must not be
represented as completed.

### Start a new cycle

From `SIGNED_OFF` or retained `CANCELLED`:

1. Determine the reconciliation obligation that the new cycle would carry. From
   `SIGNED_OFF`, it is `NONE`. From retained `CANCELLED`, preserve any existing
   obligation and, unless the user explicitly confirms that the just-cancelled
   cycle left no project changes because none were produced or they were
   reverted, include that cycle's unique `Id` and request summary.
2. Determine the legal mode before mutating terminal state. If
   `PendingCycleRequest` is not `UNSET`, treat it as the new request for this
   transition unless the user explicitly revises it; do not require the user to
   restate it. When `PendingCycleMode` is set, validate it against that request,
   current `ProjectMode`, and the reconciliation obligation. Otherwise `STANDARD` is the
   default, except that a brownfield `EXPEDITED` cycle may be inferred from
   Developer entry as defined in **Cycle Modes**. Any unresolved reconciliation
   requires `STANDARD`. If a pending preference is invalid, leave the terminal
   state, `Active Work`, `CycleMode`, and `PendingCycleMode` unchanged; persist
   the new request in `PendingCycleRequest`, persist the required user decision
   in `PendingCycleBlockedOn`, do not write `Active Work.BlockedOn`, and ask the
   user to replace or clear the preference, revise the pending request, or
   abandon it. A later resolution must use the persisted pending request rather
   than requiring the user to restate it.
3. After mode validation succeeds, allocate the new ID through **Cycle ID
   Registry**. If the registry append cannot be persisted, leave terminal state
   unchanged and do not start the cycle. Once appended, the ID is reserved even
   if a later state write fails.
4. Record `Handoff.Kind: NEW_CYCLE`, `Handoff.From` = prior terminal state,
   `FailureType: NONE`, and a concise reason. Persist the reserved ID and new
   `Request` into `Active Work`; reset `Scope`, `Architecture`, `Development`,
   `PromotionReason`, `AuditTarget`, and `BlockedOn` to `NONE`; clear recovery
   and outstanding obligations; persist the reconciliation obligation determined
   in step 1.
5. Persist the validated mode into `CycleMode`; clear `PendingCycleMode` to
   `UNSET`, `PendingCycleRequest` to `UNSET`, and `PendingCycleBlockedOn` to
   `NONE`. If reconciliation is unresolved or cancelled-cycle changes are being
   retained or adopted, set `WorkflowState: AUDITING` so Auditor can establish
   baseline status first and mention the obligation concisely in
   `Handoff.Reason` without duplicating its source-cycle provenance there.
6. Otherwise initialize a standard cycle from `ProjectMode`, or an allowed
   expedited brownfield cycle at `DEVELOPING`. `CycleMode` must not remain
   `UNSET` after this transition. The prior cycle is not reopened.

A greenfield bootstrap cancellation removes the runtime, so future workflow work
requires fresh installation and a fresh project-mode decision.

At `AWAITING_USER_SIGNOFF`, available actions are sign off, rework, or cancel;
for expedited work, explicit promotion is also available. Bounded expedited
rework follows normal recovery back to sign-off. Rework requiring a skipped
standard guarantee promotes and restarts the standard brownfield topology at
`AUDITING`.

### Greenfield Bootstrap Cancellation

If cancellation occurs while `ProjectMode` is still `GREENFIELD`, first verify
that the active cycle has not successfully created or materially modified a
project implementation artifact. If such implementation exists, persist the
permanent `BROWNFIELD` transition and use retained brownfield `CANCELLED`
semantics instead. Only when no such implementation exists should cancellation
be treated as a S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. reset rather than a reusable terminal cycle.

The reset must:

- read `.standards/INSTALLATION.json` before removal and revert only
  client-setting mutations recorded there as framework-created; remove a setting
  only when its current value still exactly matches the recorded installed
  value; preserve all others;
- remove the `.standards/` runtime and project-local S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. skill or
  framework files injected by the installer;
- remove only the bounded S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. integration block from `AGENTS.md`
  and `CLAUDE.md`; delete either file only if no non-whitespace content remains;
- leave all project files and role-owned workflow artifacts outside the runtime
  untouched.

S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. does not restore the project working tree. Reverting project
changes is the user's responsibility.

Managed block boundaries define framework ownership; do not decide whether to
delete `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` based on who originally created the file. An
existing unbounded `@AGENTS.md` import is user-owned and preserved.

The reset removes `STATE.md` and `CYCLE_IDS.md`, so no persisted `CANCELLED`
state or runtime cycle-ID registry remains. Removal of the runtime ends the
registry-backed no-reuse guarantee. The next workflow attempt requires fresh
installation, which re-evaluates project mode from then-current state and starts
a new cycle-ID registry. Do not carry the cancelled bootstrap's former
`GREENFIELD` classification across reinstall.

This exception ends permanently once Developer observes and verifies that the
active cycle has successfully created or materially modified a project
implementation artifact, regardless of authorship; cancellation after that point
uses retained brownfield `CANCELLED` semantics even if recovery has moved to an
earlier workflow state.

## Installed Runtime Contract

An installed project should provide:

- `AGENTS.md`: project-facing entrypoint to the protocol and role skills;
- `CLAUDE.md`: Claude Code compatibility entrypoint importing `AGENTS.md`;
- `.standards/PROTOCOL.md`: installed canonical protocol;
- `.standards/INSTALLATION.json`: installer-owned metadata for only the
  client-setting mutations S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. actually created;
- `.standards/CYCLE_IDS.md`: protocol-owned append-only registry of allocated
  cycle IDs for the lifetime of the installed runtime;
- `.standards/MODE.md`: current `ProjectMode`;
- `.standards/STATE.md`: current workflow/cycle state and resumable coordination
  context;
- the S.T.A.N.D.A.R.D.S. workflow skills installed in the location required by
  the selected coding agent;
- explicit-invocation controls: Codex adapters use
  `allow_implicit_invocation: false`; Claude Code project settings use
  `skillOverrides.<skill>: "user-invocable-only"` for installed workflow skills.

`.standards/MODE.md` contains exactly one canonical `ProjectMode`; its
greenfield-to-brownfield transition follows **Project Modes**.
`.standards/STATE.md` contains exactly one canonical `WorkflowState` and
`CycleMode` and follows **Persisted Workflow State**.
`.standards/INSTALLATION.json` is installer metadata, not workflow state: create
it on first installation, preserve/update it across normal reinstall or upgrade,
and record only mutations the installer actually created. Never retroactively
claim compatible pre-existing settings. `.standards/CYCLE_IDS.md` is protocol
coordination data, not installer metadata; preserve it for the entire lifetime
of the installed runtime as defined by **Cycle ID Registry**.

### Installer File Preservation

Installation must be idempotent and preserve project-owned instructions.
Before creating, replacing, updating, or removing a framework-controlled runtime
path or installed skill package, verify ownership deterministically.

Ownership rules:

- `.standards/` is framework-owned only when `.standards/PROTOCOL.md` contains
  `<!-- standards:framework-owned -->`. Otherwise report a path collision and
  do not adopt, overwrite, or remove it.
- An installed skill package is framework-owned only when its root `SKILL.md`
  carries the same marker. Otherwise report a skill collision and do not
  overwrite, merge, or remove it.
- Framework source `PROTOCOL.md` and root workflow `SKILL.md` files must retain
  the marker. Never infer ownership from names, paths, or similar content.

After ownership checks:

- Create `AGENTS.md` from `templates/common/AGENTS.md` if absent. Otherwise
  preserve existing content and add or update only the bounded block between
  `<!-- standards:start -->` and `<!-- standards:end -->`.
- Create `CLAUDE.md` from `templates/common/CLAUDE.md` if absent. If an existing
  user-owned unbounded `@AGENTS.md` import exists, preserve it and do not add a
  framework duplicate. Otherwise add or update a bounded integration block. If
  multiple unbounded imports exist, preserve them and report the conflict.
- Before replacing `.standards/PROTOCOL.md` during an upgrade, inspect the
  currently installed protocol. If it already requires **Cycle ID Registry**,
  require the existing registry to be present and valid enough to preserve; if
  it is unexpectedly missing, stop and report the incomplete runtime. If the
  currently installed protocol predates the registry, create and seed
  `.standards/CYCLE_IDS.md` as defined by **Cycle ID Registry** and persist that
  migration before replacing `PROTOCOL.md`. This pre-update check is what
  distinguishes a legitimate pre-registry migration from a damaged
  registry-aware runtime.
- Update `.standards/PROTOCOL.md` from the installed framework version only
  after runtime ownership verification and any required cycle-registry migration
  above. Install or update each skill definition only after that destination
  skill package passes its ownership check. Keep the installed protocol aligned
  with the installed skills.
- Preserve Codex `allow_implicit_invocation: false`.
- For Claude Code, safely merge `.claude/settings.json` while preserving
  unrelated settings: add each missing required
  `skillOverrides.<skill>: "user-invocable-only"` and record that exact created
  key/value in `.standards/INSTALLATION.json`; preserve an already-compatible
  unowned value without claiming it; report conflicting values rather than
  overriding them. Existing manifest ownership remains valid only for the exact
  path and installed value recorded.
- Preserve an existing verified `.standards/INSTALLATION.json` and update only
  installer-owned metadata. If it is unexpectedly missing from an otherwise
  verified runtime, stop and report the incomplete runtime; never reconstruct
  ownership by inference.
- Preserve existing `.standards/MODE.md` and `.standards/STATE.md` on normal
  reinstall; initialize them only on first install or explicit reinitialization.
  On framework upgrade, a required protocol-owned coordination field or section
  introduced by the new protocol may be added with a semantically neutral default
  only when it is absent; do not reset, reinterpret, or discard existing workflow
  state.
- Initialize `.standards/CYCLE_IDS.md` on first install. Thereafter preserve it
  across reinstall, upgrade, and explicit workflow reinitialization; never clear
  or rewrite existing entries while the runtime remains installed. If it is
  unexpectedly missing from a verified runtime whose installed protocol already
  requires the registry, stop and report the incomplete runtime; do not recreate
  it empty or reconstruct it by inference. A verified pre-registry upgrade must
  complete the pre-`PROTOCOL.md` migration described above before the new
  protocol is installed or any new cycle is allocated.
- Preserve `.standards/CONTEXT.md`; it is Auditor-owned, not installer-owned.
- Preserve project-level instructions. When they materially conflict with the
  protocol, integration contract, workflow artifacts, or other authoritative
  constraints, follow **Instruction Layering and Conflicts**.
- Reinstallation must not duplicate managed blocks/imports, reset workflow
  mode/state, or erase project instructions.

Installation does not fabricate completed workflow artifacts such as scope,
technical design, project context, tests, reviews, or documentation.

## Canonical Terms

Use these terms consistently across all skills:

- **completed scope**: scope artifact that passed Scoper's completion gate; it
  does not imply separate user approval unless the project adds such a gate.
- **scope-level acceptance conditions**: observable outcomes owned by Scoper,
  each identified by a stable `AC-NNN` for the active cycle.
- **acceptance identifier**: Scoper's stable `AC-NNN` reference reused by
  downstream artifacts.
- **retired acceptance identifier**: an ID whose condition was removed or
  materially replaced; retained so it cannot be reused and no longer a current
  coverage or verification obligation.
- **technical acceptance criteria**: Architect-derived technical conditions
  linked to scope-level acceptance identifiers.
- **development plan**: Developer-owned persisted implementation plan for the
  active cycle. It decomposes the active contract into stable `DEV-NNN` steps,
  records collaboration mode and resumable progress, and never replaces scope,
  architecture, Tester verification, review, or documentation.
- **project context**: Auditor-owned baseline stored at `.standards/CONTEXT.md`.
  It may persist as evidence across cycles, but cycle-scoped non-baseline entries
  follow the lifecycle in **Persisted Workflow State**. Planned implementation
  does not automatically stale the baseline. `PROJECT_CONTEXT` failure means
  context is materially incomplete, incorrect, or unexpectedly invalidated.
- **completion gate**: conditions required before a role may make a forward
  handoff.
- **failure handoff**: routing a defect to the owner of the affected artifact or
  decision.
- **forward handoff**: advancing after the current completion gate succeeds.
- **resume handoff**: completing a recovery frame by returning to `ResumeAt`, or
  another recovery-directed non-forward transition.
- **cycle mode**: persisted cycle-topology selection, distinct from
  `ProjectMode`; `UNSET` means no topology is currently selected, while
  `STANDARD` and `EXPEDITED` are executable assurance topologies.
- **expedited cycle**: bounded brownfield cycle consisting of Developer then
  implementation Reviewer, with possible sign-off without fabricated skipped
  standard roles or artifacts.
- **promotion handoff**: one-way `PROMOTE` transition from expedited to standard
  that restarts brownfield workflow at `AUDITING` because an omitted guarantee
  is required.
- **recovery frame**: one corrective defect plus routing, preserving owner,
  reason, interrupted `ResumeAt`, and any `RerunThrough` boundary.
- **outstanding obligation**: unresolved corrective work detached from obsolete
  recovery routing, preserving only its owner, failure type, and reason until the
  owning state resolves it.
- **active work**: persisted cycle identity, request, scope/architecture/
  development artifact references, promotion reason, baseline-reconciliation
  provenance, transient audit target, and blocking question; in terminal states
  it describes the latest cycle until `NEW_CYCLE` replaces it.

Do not introduce alternate names for these concepts inside individual skills
unless this protocol is updated first.
