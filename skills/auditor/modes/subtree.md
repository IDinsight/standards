# Subtree Audit

Use when a usable project-level `.standards/CONTEXT.md` already exists and the audit has an explicitly identified target area whose local facts require deeper inspection or refresh.

A subtree scan supplements the project baseline; it does not replace the need for a usable repository-level baseline.

## Procedure

1. Identify the target subtree from persisted active work, an upstream artifact, an active `PROJECT_CONTEXT` defect, or `Active Work.AuditTarget`. If the target comes only from explicit user direction while Auditor owns `AUDITING`, persist it in `Active Work.AuditTarget` before relying on it.
2. Inspect the target subtree and only the external code, shared packages, configuration, tests, or integrations needed to understand its real boundaries and dependencies.
3. Preserve still-valid global context. Replace or extend only the facts materially affected by the targeted scan.
4. Do not infer project-wide conventions from one subtree unless corroborating repository-level evidence establishes them.
5. Rewrite `.standards/CONTEXT.md` as one coherent baseline using `../template.md`; do not append a separate subtree audit log.

## Mode-specific completion condition

The project-level baseline remains intact, and the target area's relevant structure, behavior, constraints, dependencies, and evidence are accurate enough for the active cycle.
