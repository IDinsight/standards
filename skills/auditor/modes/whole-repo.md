# Whole-Repository Audit

Use whenever no usable project-context baseline exists, except for the scheduled initial `GREENFIELD` audit after Scope and Architecture are complete. This includes the initial `BROWNFIELD` audit and an early `GREENFIELD` `PROJECT_CONTEXT` recovery before the scheduled post-Architecture greenfield audit.

The goal is to establish `.standards/CONTEXT.md` from primary repository evidence and whatever upstream workflow artifacts already exist, without requiring artifacts that have not yet been completed and without turning the result into an exhaustive repository inventory.

## Procedure

1. Start from `Active Work.Request`, project instructions, and the repository itself.
2. Map the project at repository level before going deep:
   - purpose and major runtime boundaries;
   - languages, runtimes, frameworks, package/build tooling;
   - major source, test, configuration, documentation, and deployment areas;
   - established commands and conventions;
   - external systems, persistence, and integration boundaries;
   - testing and verification mechanisms.
3. Follow dependencies and shared packages only far enough to understand the active work and the constraints it inherits.
4. For monorepos, establish global conventions plus the target workspace and material shared dependencies; do not deep-audit unrelated workspaces.
5. Deepen the scan only in areas relevant to the active request or required to establish project-wide constraints.
6. Write `.standards/CONTEXT.md` using `../template.md`.

## Mode-specific completion condition

The resulting baseline must be sufficient for downstream roles to work without rediscovering the repository's fundamental structure, tooling, conventions, and relevant existing behavior.
