# Foundation Architecture

Use when the scope requires establishing or materially redefining the project's foundational technical structure, major system boundaries, or platform-level choices.

Focus on decisions that shape later implementation across the project rather than one bounded capability.

## Design Emphasis

1. Define the major runtime, service, module, persistence, deployment, or integration boundaries that implementation must respect.
2. Resolve foundational technology and structural choices only when they materially affect the scoped work.
3. Make dependency direction, ownership, lifecycle, and cross-boundary contracts explicit where they constrain later design.
4. Identify foundational constraints that future features must inherit without turning the design into a general style guide.
5. Keep reversible local implementation choices with Developer.
