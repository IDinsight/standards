# Stepwise Mode

Use after the user approves the current development plan when Developer should
implement one atomic step at a time and let the user control progression.

## Procedure

1. Start at the first approved step that is not `DONE`.
2. Set it to `IN_PROGRESS`, implement it, and run its self-check.
3. Set it to `DONE` only when the expected outcome exists.
4. Summarize the completed `DEV-NNN`, material files or areas changed, and the
   self-check result.
5. If another approved step remains, persist `Active Work.BlockedOn` as a
   concise request to continue with the next step and stop.
6. When the user continues, clear that blocker and execute exactly the next
   approved step unless the user revises the plan or changes collaboration mode.

A request to adjust a future step may be a plan revision. If it materially
changes implementation intent, return the plan to `PROPOSED` and obtain approval
before implementing the changed step.
